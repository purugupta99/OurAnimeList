Guts is the protagonist of the story. He is a tall, muscular man with a huge sword called the Dragon Slayer, a prosthetic left forearm that has a magnetic grip which also conceals a cannon. Guts is a tragic hero; he is born as one who may be able to struggle against Causality, but seemingly unable to affect it on a large scale.

Note: His name has often times been translated by some English scanlation groups as ""Gatts,"" or ""Gutts,"" or ""Gattsu."" However, the official translation provided to Dark Horse Comics by Kentaro Miura himself, is in fact, ""Guts."""
Griffith;Griffith  (グリフィス);"Griffith ""The White Hawk, The Hawk of Light, Femto"" ";"
Griffith is the main antagonist of the series. He was the founder and leader of the mercenary unit known as the Band of the Hawk, named for his helmet which was forged in the shape of a Hawk's head.

Extraordinarily charismatic, intelligent, and handsome, his skill with his sabre and tactics gives him and his band the reputation of invincibility, making him the favored choice of the Midland King, who was locked in a century long war with the Empire of Chuder.


Believing that he is destined for greater things than the average man, Griffith is willing to sacrifice everything for the dream of his own kingdom and only values others so far as they are useful to him. The one exception seems to be Guts and Casca, both of whom he confides to in private moments. The source of his ambition is a Behelit given to him by a fortune teller she claimed was ""The Egg of the King,"" which could lead an average person to becoming King himself."
Casca;Casca  (キャスカ);"Casca ""Elaine"" ";"
Casca was the only female soldier in the original Band of the Hawk and is behind only to Guts and Griffith in swordsmanship. Her ambivalent relationship to both of them makes her moody and capricious. Casca joins the Band of the Hawk after Griffith saves her from a sexual assault by a nobleman."
Schierke;Schierke  (シールケ);Schierke  ;"
Schierke is a young witch-in-training, a disciple of the witch Flora. She is accompanied by an elf, Evarella. She aided Guts's group with a troll infestation in the nearby village Enoch, where she showed how powerful magic can be in Berserk.

After a series of events, Schierke was forced to leave her home and Flora behind forever when they faced an attack Griffith ordered. Schierke, having lived a sheltered life, doesn't like the Human world or the Holy See's religion, but she finds life outside bearable due to her companions.

Her magic skills and knowledge of the world are impressive for a child her age. One of her most used and handiest spells is the ability to hypnotize or temporarily desensitize others. But due to her youth, she tends to exhibit dangerous overzealousness. Her ability to sense ""Od"" (life force or spirit energy) means she can sense the power, intent, and alignment of all creatures and artifacts.

As she sees Isidro as an incompetent monkey, there is some friction between the two, which frequently lends itself to comic situations. Though she initially couldn't stand Guts, Schierke has developed a slight infatuation with him and both now share a father-daughter relationship. When Sonia gave her an offer to join the Band of the Hawk, Schierke thought of Guts before declining. Their journey together constantly brings them into even deeper understanding."
Puck;Puck  (パック);Puck  ;"
A wind spirit from Elfhelm, a utopia on the island Skellig in the Western Sea. Elves in Berserk can only be seen by the open-minded; the devoutly religious cannot see Puck at all, though he can play with their face unbeknownst to them. Puck can secrete a powder from his wings to quickly heal wounds and can emit a bright flash to blind enemies. On occasion, he also resorts to his ""Bloody Needle"" attack, tossing a spiny object resembling a seed pod at someone. It deals no injury, but is painful enough to prompt most victims to cry out. Puck was the first to join Guts's journey, and is starting to show a strange attachment to the Behelit Guts took upon his battle with the Count.

Puck often serves as comic relief along with Isidro. The two are frequently drawn in an exaggerated manner. He is very angry when he ever is mixed up with a Pixie or Fairy quick to state the difference. He also seems to have a brother-sister relationship with the newest comic relief character the female elf Evarella.

Serpico;Serpico  (セルピコ);Serpico  ;"
Serpico is Farnese's companion and unbeknownst to her, her paternal half-brother. During his time with the Holy See, Serpico was Herald for the Holy Iron Chain Knights.

When aggressive, Serpico belies his meek appearance and is comparable to a fox due to his shrewd observation and speed with a rapier.

Despite Farnese's childhood abuse and her forcing him to burn his own mother at the stake, he cares deeply for his half-sister. Serpico was her servant since she found him beaten on a snowy street over a decade ago.

Serpico's relationship with Guts has forever been plagued with animosity, due in large part to the dangers that inevitably surround Guts and anyone he takes into his Band. After a duel with Guts in the underground pillars of Vritannis, Guts spared his life. Their bond rekindled, and Serpico has since learned to trust Guts to protect Farnese when he can not.

Serpico uses two items blessed by the wind spirit Sylph in order to battle with tolerance alongside Guts: a rapier that can generate razor sharp gusts of wind; and a cloak that constantly generates a swirling vortex around its wearer which can deflect projectiles, assist in jumping, and slow falls from great heights."
de Vandimion, Farnese;Farnese de Vandimion (ファルネーゼ・ド・ヴァンディミオン);"Farnese ""The Devil Child of Vandimion, Wandering Princess"" de Vandimion";"
Farnese is a noblewoman who led the Holy See's ceremonial guard, the Holy Iron Chain Knights. Since this position has been traditionally held by a woman, Farnese was appointed during her stay at the convent she was sent to by her father, Federico Vandimion.

A bit of a pyromaniac (and possibly a pyrophiliac), Farnese's habit of maniacally burning things she didn't like, along with her lack of empathy due to her poor upbringing provoked her to hunt down and burn supposed witches and pagans at the stake. This fueled a secret sadistic pleasure that she constantly tried to deny.

She and Serpico left their Holy See positions after her faith was shattered during the devastation of Albion and the events surrounding Griffith's reincarnation. She then chose to follow Guts in hopes of learning more about the world and has changed into a more sympathetic human being. Since then, Farnese has begun to study witchcraft under Schierke's tutelage. Farnese also seems to have developed a crush on Guts which becomes evident in chapter 287 and 288 of the manga.

Farnese is primarily Casca's care taker and thus rarely involves herself in battles. She and Casca both received enchanted chainmail shirts made of silver as well as a silver short sword for protection against creatures from the astral plane. During Ganishka's raid on Vritanis, she also received a trio of snake-like homonculi created by Schierke from thorn vines which Farnese remote controls with a vine ring."
Isidro;Isidro  (イシドロ);Isidro  ;"
A runaway brat turned thief, Isidro dreams of becoming a great swordsman, which made him tag along with Guts. Despite his lack of strength and skill, he utilizes his small size and agility to his advantage, along with various tricks and tools. He has a great ego and plans to become the very best; he initially planned to ""observe"" Guts and steal his ""techniques"" to surpass him. But he slowly starts to realize the inconceivable difference in strength between him and Guts, but that there may even be ways for him to become a formidable warrior...

His most important role however, is probably to serve as a comic relief along with Puck."
The Skull Knight;The Skull Knight  (髑髏の騎士);The Skull Knight  ;"
The Skull Knight is one of the most mysterious and prolific characters introduced in Berserk, a towering warrior dressed in full armor whose ornaments, especially his helmet, are shaped as parts of a human skeleton, hence his moniker, who rides a massive, ghostly black horse. Though ominous and macabre, he is an enemy of the Godhand and its acolytes, hunting down Apostles and devouring their Behelits; especially bitter is his rivalry with Zodd the Immortal, whom he was often showed to overwhelm with ease.

He wields a powerful sword that, when stuck down his throat, becomes a terrible, Behelit-coated blade capable of slashing rifts through reality itself, thus allowing the Skull Knight to move freely around the world or even between different dimensions.


This enigmatic knight saved Guts in more than one occasion, notably during the infamous Eclipse which saw Griffith become a member of the Hand of God or when Slan almost slaughtered him, though he never explained why, simply declaring that the Struggler (the way he calls Guts) has to keep following his fate.

It is heavily speculated that, during his life as a mortal, the Skull Knight was in fact Gaiseric, the warlord that unified the Midland and became its first Emperor, notorious for his helmet whose shape was that of a human skull and whose ambitions 'prompted God to send four Angels' (most likely the four members of the Hand of God) to punish him.

He was the wearer of the Berserker's Armor, and knew the witch Flora. During the duel between Griffith and Ganishka he suddenly appeared out of thin air through a dimensional rift, trying to land a fatal blow on the Hawk, only to see it diverted on the writhing body of the Kushan Emperor."
Judeau;Judeau  (ジュドー);Judeau  ;"
The old Band of the Hawk's friendly mediator. A former circus performer who wielded throwing knives, Judeau was also well-aware of the world around him and was seen as a confidant for many of The Hawks. Throughout his stay with the Band of the Hawk, he was secretly in love with Casca, but never acted on it out of respect for Guts' and Casca's feelings for each other."
Zeppeli, Gyro;Gyro Zeppeli (ユリウス・カエサル・ツェペリ);"Gyro ""Julius Caesar, J-lo"" Zeppeli";"
Born Julius Caesar Zeppeli, but more commonly referred to as ""Gyro Zeppeli"".

Gyro has a cocky and flamboyant personality, appearing to have a high opinion of himself. However, he can be driven by emotions for other people and become realistic and serious when a problem presents itself. Like most Manga archetypes, Gyro is incredibly intelligent when he needs to be. His most distinguishable body features are his long hair, western hat and his gold teeth which have ""GO! GO! ZEPPELI"" displayed on them, revealed whenever he smiles at someone. His signature laugh/chuckle is ""Nyo ho ho ho~"".

Note that the ""Caesar"" in his name is pronounced in the traditional Greek way, more akin to the German ""Kaiser"". This is distinct from Caesar Anthonio Zeppeli from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 2, whose name is pronounced in the modern English way.


In the final battle against Funny Valentine, Gyro uses the most advanced technique of the Golden Rectangle: the ""Super (or Cavalry) Spin"", which is created by invoking the golden rectangle while riding a horse to gain momentum. By combining this technique with his newly developed stand Ball Breaker, his attack becomes very powerful. Although his technique is very effective, it is not enough to beat Valentine, who resists his injuries long enough for Gyro to die from his own wounds. However, before dying, Gyro gives his last lesson to Johnny, allowing Tusk to reach ACT 4 and giving Johnny the power to defeat Funny Valentine."
Joestar, Johnny;Johnny Joestar (ジョニィ・ジョースター);"Johnny ""Jonathan, Joe Kid, JoJo"" Joestar";"
Johnny Joestar, also known as ""Joe Kid"" or ""JoJo"", was a racing prodigy. However, when waiting in line for a play, the girl he was with convinced him to cut to the front of the line and bribe the bouncers to throw out the youth in the front of the line, who had been waiting through the night. The youth shot Johnny, resulting in his being paralyzed from the waist down and sent to a hospital, where he was physically abused. Having lost all the friends and respect he had earned as a jockey, no one visited him during his stay in the hospital.

Near the beginning of the series Steel Ball Run, Johnny Joestar encountered Gyro Zeppeli and was brought to his feet upon touching Gyro's steel ball. Believing Gyro to be capable of teaching him to walk, Johnny joined the Steel Ball Race and followed him to be trained.


Johnny earns a Stand named ""Tusk"" when they venture into the Devil's Palm as a result of their fight with Dio and Dr. Ferdinand. Tusk is able to fire Johnny's spinning fingernails similar to a revolver, with the nails having to take a few seconds to regrow. This long range attack becomes his primary means of defense. His Stand is small in size and has the same star-pattern over it as on Johnny's clothing, it appears to reside inside of him and only comes out to offer advice. It cannot speak, only make animal-like noises. Later in the series, Johnny masters Gyro's ""Spin"" technique and uses it with his Stand's fingernail bullets; at one time, even being able to use it on himself. His Stand also evolves although remaining similar in appearance, now able to fire from the toenails on Johnny's paralyzed feet.

Jesus then traveled east across the continent, learning new languages and cultures until he reached the sea. Making a ship with the help of the locals, he set off across the sea to what would be known as America, where he lived, aged, and was finally put to rest. He seemed to have at least partial connection with the natives, who stated prior to his deathbed that they wished to see him. Shortly after his death, a large earthquake tore the ground apart, dividing his corpse by the movement of sand and relocating it to the different areas of America that would become the nine locations on Joseph of Arimathea's map.

Affiliations: State Military

Species: Human
Occupation: State Alchemist
Abilities: Alchemy, Martial Arts
Weapon: Alchemy, Automail arm and leg

Edward ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" Elric is a young alchemical prodigy. He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed's primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a ""hero of the people"" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn't seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al's suffering.

Edward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4'11""), however his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. Although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, Ed's ability to fight is not impaired, and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. His heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in Amestris. They were made by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. He is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. These qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter.

Born to Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim of Resembool in the winter of 1899, Edward's first few years were relatively happy; but after the sudden departure of his father during the lad's formative years, Ed was left with his mother and younger brother Alphonse as his only family. The three Elrics lived in peace in the rural village and the boys began displaying a remarkable talent for alchemy at a young age, much to the joyful astonishment of his mother. However, early in the year 1904, Trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. Even while mourning, mired in grief, Edward vowed to his brother that the two of them would find a way to bring their dear mother back to life with the power of alchemy.

Edward and Alphonse spent the next few years living on their own in the Elric family home, supported by their close childhood friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako, and pursuing the alchemical knowledge necessary for their planned resurrection. Although they had gained a great deal of information and comprehension regarding the extended basics of the craft, before long it became apparent to the young prodigies that there was only so far they could go while being self-taught. In a stroke of good fortune, Resembool was visited by an exceptionally skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis who, after some persuasion, agreed to take the Elric brothers on as her apprentices provided they pass a preliminary test. After they do, the Elric brothers were subjected to Izumi's intensive alchemy and martial arts training, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to Resembool.

Though instructed specifically by Izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the ""One is All, All is One"" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics to a forbidden practice called Human Transmutation.

Devising a Human Transmutation Circle, amassing the elemental ingredients for an adult human body and offering their own blood as soul and biological data, the boys secretly initiated the Human Transmutation in their home. Unfortunately, the Human Transmutation resulted in a Rebound.

Alphonse and Edward were pulled into The Gate. Encountering the mysterious being called Truth, Edward was stripped of his left leg in exchange for crossing into God's domain and peeking at the Gate's vast wealth of alchemical knowledge. Maimed and bleeding, Edward was returned to the human dimension to find that Alphonse had not yet returned from his disappearance into the Gate, that the mother they had attempted to revive was a grotesque mass of organs only capable of sustaining life for a few moments and that his own sojourn into the Gate had granted him the curious ability to perform transmutations merely by clapping his hands together, without the aid of a Transmutation Circle - in the same style used by Izumi. Desperate to at least have his brother by his side, Edward willfully performed another Human Transmutation to call him back, this time sacrificing his right arm in exchange for Al's soul, which he bound alchemically to an antique suit of armor with a Blood Rune before passing out from severe blood loss. Alphonse carried Ed to the Rockbell house, where a shocked Pinako and Winry performed emergency surgery to save the young boy's life.

On the night of the failed transmutation. Lt. Colonel Flame alchemist Roy Mustang came to the Rockbell's in response to a letter that Edward and Alphonse had sent him in the mail asking about their Father. He was shocked at the fact that the two boys had tried human alchemy and survived, and informed them that they could become state alchemist and maybe one day find a way to return their bodies to the way they were. Desperate to get His younger brother's body back, Edward asked the Rockbells to give him prosthetic limbs called automail. Though they warned him the surgery would be painful, he said the pain was nothing compared to what his brother had given up. He only took a year to adapt to the automail at age 11 when it took most adults 3 years."

Alphonse Elric is a fictional character in the manga and anime series Fullmetal Alchemist. He is a human child who lost his body during a forbidden alchemical transmutation to bring his deceased mother back to life, and had his soul transmuted into a suit of armor by his brother, Edward Elric. Al's blood seal lies just below the base of the neck at the back of the suit, on the inside. It is drawn with Ed's blood. According to Edward, he needs to be careful whenever he reconstructs Alphonse's body because he must keep the blood seal intact during the transmutation. If the blood seal is removed, Al's soul will be lost.

Mustang, Roy;Roy Mustang (ロイ・マスタング);"Roy ""Flame Alchemist"" Mustang";"
Birthday: 1885 (Age 30 from vol. 10)
Height: 5'8"" (173 cm)

Roy Mustang is the ""Flame Alchemist,"" having absolute control over heat and fire through alchemy. Using special gloves that create a spark when he snaps his fingers, Roy can create anything from a tiny ember to burn a letter, to a raging inferno that can destroy a humanoid body in seconds. His precise control over the alchemically enhanced flame is so accurate that he can boil the water in a persons' eyes and can also attack enemies amongst a riot without hurting any allies.

Outwardly arrogant and playfully manipulative, Mustang is intelligent and almost always one step ahead of his opponents, and likes to feel in control of the situation. He is one of the superiors of Edward Elric. On the surface, he appears to be nothing more than a man of the military who pursues promotions and praise and is considered a ladies' man who constantly goes on dates with different women. Mustang's true goal is to become Führer in order to gain the power to reform the government in order to absolve his sins in the Ishval War as well as change the country for the better, along with the joking requirement for female officers to wear tiny miniskirts (which considerably increased Havoc's loyalty to him and caused Hawkeye to be angry with him).

His goals are admirable enough that he earns the fierce loyalty of his good friends Lt Col. Maes Hughes, Major Alex Louis Armstrong, and his own subordinates, among whom are Riza Hawkeye, Jean Havoc, Heymans Breda, Vato Falman, and Kain Fuery. While Mustang has a close and amicable relationship with all of his subordinates, he appears to share a deeper bond of affection with his second-in-command Riza Hawkeye, who has devoted her life to supporting him. This bond culminates in the final episodes of the anime when Mustang chooses Hawkeye alone to accompany him on his greatest and most dangerous mission.

Though a hero of the Ishval War, he remains haunted by the horrors of war and suffers great remorse for the lives he took.


After the Promised Day arrives, he is forced to open the gate by Pride and Wrath, they first try to make him do it voluntarily by reviving Hawkeye, but he refuses. So Pride opens the gate for him using his Philosopher's Stone. Mustang gains the power to transmute without a circle, however his price is his eyesight.

Hughes, Maes;Maes Hughes (マース･ヒューズ);Maes  Hughes;"
Maes Hughes is a character that is hard not to love. He is often seen as the comedy relief but has his debuts as a serious and skilled fighter. He is best friends with Roy Mustang (and would do anything to help Roy achieve his goals) and a loving and devoted husband/father. Maes would do anything for his wife Gracia and always carries pictures of his daughter Elycia in his uniform and never misses a chance to show everyone how cute she is. He starts out in the anime as a Major in the Investigation Division and eventually becomes a Lieutenant Colonel.


He is killed by Envy upon his discovery of Father's plans, and is posthumously promoted to Brigadier General after his death."
Greed;Greed  (グリード);Greed  ;"
Greed is a greedy Homunculus, nicknamed the ""Ultimate Shield"". He is able to rearrange the carbon in his body to make his skin as hard as diamond, thus making himself almost impossible to injure. As his name implies he is a very avaricious character, who likes living in luxury, surrounded by powerful minions and beautiful women. Despite his generally greedy nature, he is shown to honestly care for his subordinates. He also has a habit of flipping people off in the manga.


In the 2003 anime series
Greed is the second oldest of the Homunculi created by Dante. However, due to his avarice, Greed rebelled and was eventually captured and imprisoned in lab 5. He was imprisoned for 130 years until an explosion broke his seal. He then freed the caged chimera at Lab 5 in exchange for helping him get his revenge on the other homunculi and their master.


In the manga and 2009 anime series
He is the third Homunculus created by Father. Greed apparently abandoned the other Homunculi over 100 years before the start of the series and claims to be around two centuries old. He first appears hiding in the Devil's Nest in Dublith, with his gang of chimeras all of whom he apparently rescued from military experimentation.


After Greed is punished by Father, he later returns as Father removes his son's Philosophers Stone core from his own body and inserts it directly into the body of Ling Yao to create a second Human-based Homunculus. This second Greed maintains all the same personality and powers as the first (his Ouroboros tattoo is even in the same spot), but appears to have none of his previous memories, not recognizing Envy, Gluttony or the Elric Brothers. As such, he becomes a faithful servant of his Father, as the first Greed was presumed to have been initially, and refers to all actions prior to his rebirth as having been done by ""the other Greed"". However, as Greed is a host in Ling Yao's body, Ling is able to regain control of his body if Greed let's his guard down or allows him to. By doing this, Ling is able to regain his sixth sense of detecting another's presence, but is not able to use the Ultimate Shield. Greed is reluctant to willingly give him back his body however. After killing a past comrade and follower of his, memories from Greed's previous life returned, including his time in the Devil's Nest and the feelings he had for his followers. Remembering this, along with how Bradly killed most of his followers, leads Greed to betraying Father once again. He also stops referring to his ""previous self"" as ""the other Greed"" upon regaining his memories. After forming a temporary alliance with Edward and company, Greed and Ling help in the fight against the Homunculi and the Central Troopers. In the afternath, as Edward, Alphonse and the military engage Father, he steps in and allows Father to absorb his Philosopher's Stone, afterwards giving Ling his body back, claiming the only thing he truly wanted were friends. He then reverses his Ultimate Sheild, turning Father into a brittle coal-like substance and fades away with his Father, a smile on his face.

Hawkeye, Riza;Riza Hawkeye (リザ・ホークアイ);Riza  Hawkeye;"
Riza Hawkeye is Roy Mustang's most trusted subordinate. She carries out many of the tasks he is too lazy to do, acts as his personal assistant, and protects him from danger. She also doubles as his voice of reason, keeping cool in heated situations and scolding him when he allows his emotions to get in the way. Riza and Roy seem to share a close relationship in both adaptations of Fullmetal Alchemist; in the anime she identifies him as her most precious person, whereas in the manga she loses her resolve to live when believing he has been killed. Riza specializes in firearms, particularly sniper rifles, and can hit nearly any target with lethal accuracy.

Rockbell, Winry;Winry Rockbell (ウィンリィ・ロックベル);"Winry ""Win"" Rockbell";"
Birthplace:
Resembool

Birth date:
June 9, 1899

Age:
15-16 (Around 18 at the end)

Family:
- Pinako Rockbell (grandmother)
- Urey Rockbell (father, deceased)
- Sara Rockbell (mother, deceased)

Affiliations:
- Rockbell Automail
- Atelier Garfiel

Occupation:
Automail mechanic

Abilities:
Automail specialist and mechanic, amateur surgeon

Unique Trait:
An unusual love for machines and tools

A childhood friend of the central characters, the Elric brothers, she is often seen in their company throughout the series. She is evidently Edward's love interest. Specializing in mechanical repair, specifically with automail, Winry services Edward's arm and leg whenever it is in need of repair or replacement.


In the manga, Winry becomes an apprentice to Garfiel, an automail engineer in Rush Valley. She also studies techniques for making automail for northern frigid conditions. Her parents, both doctors, were killed by Scar during the Ishbal war when she was very young. In chapter 47 at the Central, she tried to shoot Scar after finding out that he was the one who had killed her parents. She frequently travels with the Elrics in earlier chapters and later, returning back to Rush Valley, realizes that she has been in love with Ed for a long time, and Ed has the same feeling though he constantly denies it. It has been mentioned in chapter 15 that Alphonse and Edward had once fought over who would get to marry Winry when they were kids, making Ed freak out and become incredibly flustered, claiming that he didn't remember that. Alphonse won, but was rejected. After Ed asked her why, she replied with ""I don't like guys shorter than me,"" resulting in a huge blow on Ed's ego. Due to her importance in the lives of the Elric brothers, Winry is used as a hostage by the military to gain Edward's obedience. In order to escape from the military possession, she decided to travel with Scar and the others. It was revealed in chapter 73 that it was her plan for Scar to use her as a hostage in order to escape although she has not forgiven him for killing her parents. In chapter 84 Winry is taken on a military train back into Resembool in a water tank. When she goes into her house, she is shocked to find Ed in her room while she is undressing. They both scream which causes everyone to believe that the two of them are in danger. Shortly afterwards (after beating his head a few times), she fills Ed in on where Al is and what have been happening in Lior. Ed tells her to leave the country, but she refuses, wanting to help Ed in any way that she can. Ed soon departs, and Winry stays in Resembool for the time being. At the epilogue, Ed confesses (or maybe more like proposes) to her, and in a photo, it shown that they're married and have two children."
Envy;Envy  (エンヴィー);Envy  ;"
Envy is a homunculus who has the ability of shape-shifting. They use this power to assume the form of any person and even copy their voice. They usually serves as a spy, but their abilities are also extremely useful for assassinations. Envy may not be as smart as some of the other homunculi, but is by no means an idiot. In fact, they can be just as good a puppet master as Lust, but this is overshadowed by their cockiness and bad temper. Their temper can easily be set off by insulting their large and delicate ego, causing them to make mistakes.


In the 2003 anime series:
As the oldest Homunculus, Envy claimed that he had forgotten what he originally looked like. Envy also greatly hates all humans and followed Dante mostly for the opportunity of killing as many people as he could. This is what drove Envy in all that he did and unlike other Homunculi, Envy does not care about the Philosopher's Stone, nor about becoming human.


Towards the very end of the series it is revealed that Envy was created four hundred years ago by Hohenheim in an attempt to resurrect the son he and Dante had, who later died from mercury poisoning when he was eighteen years old. Envy held a great hatred toward Hohenheim for never being acknowledged as his son and for abandoning him and Dante.

In the manga and 2009 anime series:
Envy was the fourth Homunculus created by Father. Though often referred to as a 'he' Envy is apparently genderless and can take almost any form they choose. Referred to by Lust as the most cruel or sadistic of the Homunculi, Envy shows the most open disdain of humans and relishes in any opportunity to hurt, humiliate, or insult them. They are also quite vain and short tempered and dislike anyone insulting their appearance.


Beneath this cruel exterior however Envy is secretly envious of humans' inner strength and the mutually beneficial friendships that they share, since most of the Homunculi show little real concern or emotional support for each other.

Johan Liebert is the namesake ""monster"" of the story and the mystery of his past is the focus of the plot. He has been called a monster, the next Adolf Hitler and even the devil himself. Johan Liebert was shot in the head at a young age but saved from death by Dr. Tenma. Because of this, he is very grateful to Dr. Tenma. He has spent portions of his life in different places under different aliases and possesses an extraordinary level of charisma and intelligence. He uses his gifts to cruelly manipulate and corrupt others, often with no apparent end other than to cause suffering and destruction. His original goal, as he stated when he was young, is to be the last one standing at the end of the world, although towards the end he decides upon a different fate. One of the themes of Monster is how individuals are capable of transforming into monsters; Johan often acts as both a direct and indirect catalyst for this transformation. Johan also shows strong attachment to his twin sister, Nina Fortner/Anna Liebert and refuses to leave her behind.

""Liebheart"" is Johan's official last name according to the Japanese anime page, but ""Liebert"" is his official name according to the English translation of the manga. Please leave his name as-is."

Monkey D., Luffy;Luffy Monkey D. (モンキー・D・ルフィ);"Luffy ""Mugiwara, Straw Hat, Lucy"" Monkey D.";"
Name: Monkey D. Luffy
Age: 17; 19
Birthdate: May 5, Taurus
Height: 172 cm; 174 cm
Blood Type: F
Affiliation: Straw Hat Pirates
Position: Captain
Devil Fruit: Gomu Gomu no Mi (Gum Gum Fruit)
Type: Paramecia
Bounty:
500,000,000 (previously; 30,000,000, 100,000,000, 300,000,000, and 400,000,000)

Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and is best friends with all of them and values them over all else. At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.

Luffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young male hero/adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy's case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial ""D.""

Although Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D's. His only display of true fear is towards his grandfather, to the point that he is intimidated at the mere mention of him.

Luffy never kills any of his enemies, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or beating them to a point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Oda explains that it's not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.

Luffy's dream is to find the One Piece and become Pirate King. He knows that to achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks.


Monkey D. Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army and the world's most wanted criminal. His grandfather is ""The Hero of The Marines"", Vice Admiral Monkey D. Garp. Before the start of the series, Dragon left Luffy in Garp's care. Dragon first appears after a lightning bolt suddenly destroys the gallows where Luffy was to be executed by Buggy the Clown and then saves Luffy from being captured by Captain Smoker. When he saved Luffy from Smoker, a mighty gust of eerie wind swept through Loguetown. It is undetermined whether or not he was the cause behind the gust of wind or the lightning; however, the story leads to believe there is more to him than it seems. Recently, he has taken over an island in the South Blue and is about to head to the North Blue when he commented, after noticing Luffy's newest bounty, given to him after invading Enies Lobby, that father and son will meet sometime soon.

Roronoa, Zoro;Zoro Roronoa (ロロノア・ゾロ);"Zoro ""Pirate Hunter, Marimo"" Roronoa";"
Name: Roronoa Zoro
Age: 19; 21
Birthdate: November 11, Scorpio
Height: 178 cm (5'10"") , 181 (5'11"") (after timeskip)
Affiliation: Straw Hat Pirates
Position: Swordsman
Devil Fruit: None
Bounty:
320,000,000 (previously: 60,000,000 and 120,000,000)

Zoro was the first crew member to be recruited by Luffy. Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style).This is achieved by using one katana in each hand and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his bandana, normally tied on the arm, on his head.

Though not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood.

Zoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but, unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.

Zoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only because he knows he's a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed, and determined."

Blood type: RH-
Affiliation: Straw Hat Pirates (previously; Baratie)
Position: Cook
Devil Fruit: none
Bounty:
177,000,000 (previously: 77,000,000)
Sanji is the chain-smoking chef of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew. He has superb fighting skills that only make use of his legs, in an effort to minimize damage to his hands which would impair his cooking skills.
Except a single fight where he uses knives against a fellow chef.
Sanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef ""Red Leg"" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue.

Sanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his ""love-cook"" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. This behavior has earned him the nickname ""ero-cook,"" or perverted cook. He can also be very chivalrous and gentlemanly around woman, volunteering to help them in various tasks and situations, whether they need help or not. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can't attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a ""strict upbringing."" To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur.

His goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe.

Being the crew's chef, he looks out for the health of his crewmates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He's also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well. In short, he cares as much for the crew as any Straw Hat should, but unlike Zoro, Sanji shows these feelings more.


It is revealed that Sanji is the third son of the Vinsmokes, a family of killers. His father and one of the Yonkou, Big Mom, has arranged a marriage between him and the 35th daughter of the Charlotte family, Pudding."

Devil Fruit: Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower Fruit)
Type: Paramecia
Bounty:
130,000,000 (previously: 79,000,000; 80,000,000)
Robin is the seventh member of Straw Hat's Crew. She had a bounty of 79 million beri (One Piece currency) since she was eight years old, during an incident in which she supposedly destroyed six Buster Call ships through the use of the powers she gained by the eating the Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower or Blooming Blooming Fruit). The fruit's power enables her to conjure up multiple replicas of her body parts (most often her arms) upon any surface she is able to see making her very powerful and dexterous as a result.

Robin joined the Straw Hat Pirates after Luffy saved her life, or (how she states it) Luffy forced her to live when she wanted to die. To atone for his crime, Robin demands that Luffy allow her to join his crew, to which he complies leaving every other crew member except Sanji in shock. Although feared at first, she is quickly accepted and viewed as a comrade by the crew.

Robin is actually an archaeologist of talent, and despises anyone who thoughtlessly damages any piece of history. The World Government fears her because she can decipher Poneglyphs (stones marked with glyphs from an ancient language), which contain details capable of reviving ancient weapons that have the power to destroy the world. In reality, Robin has stated that she does not care about ancient weapons, and that her dream is to find the True History written on the Rio Poneglyph.

Robin is a mysterious and serious person who appears quiet and reclusive, and the wisest in the Straw Hat's Crew. She was thought by those around her to be cold and mean, but it was proven that she is actually a kind person who always thinks before she acts. She often only speaks when something interesting or important has happened. She loves to study history, and the comfort and freedom to study and read. She is also quick to point out gross or realistically morbid facts, often creeping out Nami or Usopp. Robin is the wisest and most sensible member of the crew. She has a vast knowledge of the seas and the world, and usually keeps her head during surprising situations, allowing her to logically analyze the situation without losing her cool. This trait makes her different from the other Straw Hats, who often comically react melodramatically to unexpected happenings and hold irrational ideas and conclusions. Despite her attempts to keep herself distant, Robin has fallen for her new friends, and has taken the role of the distant den mother."
Tony Tony, Chopper;Chopper Tony Tony (トニートニー・チョッパー);Chopper  Tony Tony;"
Age: 15, 17
Birthday: December 24
Zodiac sign: Capricorn
Affliation: Straw Hat Pirates
Position: Doctor
Devil Fruit: Hito Hito no Mi (Human Human Fruit)
Type: Zoan
Bounty:
100 (previously: 50)
He is the Straw Hat crew's general physician despite being a reindeer. After a set of unusual circumstances, he ate the Hito Hito no Mi (Human Human Fruit), which permitted him the ability to speak, think, and, to a limited extent, change into a human.

Chopper often acts like a child, but he is an upright friend and companion who will try anything to overcome a task given by his team. He also still has distrust in humankind because of events in his youth, where he was treated as a brutal monster. He will often outright insult a human who compliments him while smiling, dancing, and being obviously pleased. He also shows a certain interest in books, but mostly medicine related ones.

Chopper is more or less on a journey to define himself, seeing almost anybody on his crew as a role model. This, combined with his naiveness, often causes him to imitate the other Straw Hats' actions, no matter how obviously silly. Because of this, he often gets involved in the crazy antics of Luffy and Usopp, wholeheartedly believing that what they are doing is sensible and fun. Chopper is one of the most innocent Straw Hat Pirates, and is also very naive, resulting in a tendency to believe anything told to him, even the outrageously fictitious and exaggerated lies of Usopp. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper and continues to refer to him as ""the emergency food supply"" to tease him but considers him a friend. Although he is the crew's doctor he wasn't originally hired by Luffy for that purpose. But actually, in Luffy's words, for being ""cool reindeer that can transform."""

Sizes: 95-55-85
Affiliation: Straw Hat Pirates (previously; Arlong Pirates)
Position: Navigator
Devil Fruit: none
Bounty:
66,000,000 (previously: 16,000,000)
She is the first member of the Straw Hat Pirates to appear (in the anime), but the third to align herself with the crew, and the fifth to actually join. Possibly one of the best (or even the best) navigators currently sailing the Grand Line, she has the ability to recognize and analyze even the slightest changes in the weather through sheer intuition, thus saving the ship and the crew from the very unstable Grand Line weather on multiple occasions.

Nami has a tattoo on her left shoulder (a homage to her past), where she used to have a shark tattoo for being a member of Arlong's Crew. The new tattoo represents mikan (a fruit commonly know as tangerine) and pinwheels.

She respects Luffy's qualities as a leader, but often gets angry of his irrational thinking and short attention span, even so she trusts him with her life. Despite the fact that Nami has deceived the crew, Luffy still trusts her enough to allow her to safe-keep his precious straw hat. She is almost always the one who gives orders on the ship (much to the Zoro's resentment) because of Luffy's usual lack of common sense. She often comically beats or hits her other crewmates for their nonsense, which occurs quite often. Robin is actually the only person Nami doesn't try to boss, and she referred to her as the only person who understands her, though in a comical fashion. She is very manipulative as well and can even turn an entire conversation in her favor when necessary, often putting on disguises and tricking the enemy. Acting as the ""mother"" of the crew, Nami doesn't understand or approve of the boys' often macho attitudes and principles. These are the only situations where Nami doesn't get the final word.

Nami's two favorite things are money and tangerines. She is greedy and will do anything, aside from abandoning or killing her friends, for money. Due to her past - After having gathered money for 8 years (and even before that often stole things), Nami is naturally accustomed to it, but thinks of her friends as more important. She is very manipulative, and often takes advantage of Sanji for his devotion to her and Usopp to maintain her weapons. Roronoa Zoro tries not to fall for her schemes, but ends up a victim like the rest, usually due to debt and blackmail. Nami also tries to avoid fights, and is one of the less adventurous and brave members of the crew. However, since the invention of her Clima Tact (A weapon that forms weather patterns), she is now seen fighting her own battles instead of becoming the 'easy target', as she doesn't want to be the one being saved anymore."

Dislikes:
Failure

Usopp is a liar and likes to play pranks on his crew members or just goof off with Luffy and Chopper. He loves to tell tall tales to Chopper (who believes him blindly) or anyone who's listening. The other aspect of Usopp besides his lying is his cowardice; he is a very timid person, or so he thinks. In extremely stressful situations, Usopp has proven to be far more courageous than he believes himself to be. He shows great resolve when his friends are threatened or mocked by outsiders. Even though he is a complete coward in battle (except as his alter ego, Sogeking), he is a useful part to the Straw Hat Pirates. He is extremely handy and can fix almost anything. He sometimes sees a role model in Zoro who never seems afraid but always proud. Usopp lacks a bit of self esteem and is often taken advantage of by Nami to make her weapons or repair and improve them - something he is very adept at, having constructed the ingenious weapon ""Clima Tact.""

Usopp will also stand up and fight for not only the well-being of people, but also for their ideals - and the ideals of a pirate, which he holds very high. In battle he normally tries to trick his enemy by telling tales or mischievous lies to deceive them. Despite his lack of physical strength compared to other members of the crew, Usopp seems to be just as resilient as his comrades and this ability to bear loads and loads of damage, is one of his best traits, in addition to his cunning and intelligence, which has saved the Straw Hats on many occasions. Also, Usopp has outstanding marksmanship abilities with his slingshot and is on his way to becoming one of the best snipers in the One Piece world, although his goal in life is to become a proud and strong pirate like his father Yasopp of the Red Haired Pirate Crew."

Brook known as the ""Gentleman Skeleton"", is a pirate inhabiting the Florian Triangle region of the Grand Line. Although he claims to be a gentleman, and talks in the dialect of one, Brook's etiquette has severely degenerated over the course of his isolation. He has awful table manners: he shouts for food while waiting to be served, asks to swap plates with people who have larger servings than he does and eating so messily his entire face is stained. He is also extremely flatulent after meals, but says ""excuse me"" so as to be ""gentlemanly."" He also loves to tell odd, bone-themed jokes, as well as melodramatic tales, and is very perverted, asking to see Nami and Robin's underwear upon meeting them.

He's a skilled musician (something Luffy has always wanted in his crew since the beginning), fond of playing the violin. Due to his light weight he can not only jump to incredible heights but can run on water by moving his legs furiously. He uses a shikomizue as his main weapon; with it, he is able to make swift iaidō attacks that the enemy cannot notice."

Franky is a 34 year old cyborg who is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates and their second most recently recruited member. He first appeared in the Water 7 arc. Franky is one of ""Tom's Workers"", with original name ""Cutty Flam.""

Franky's dream is to build a ship that would travel to the end of the Grand Line. This is the ship that the Straw Hats are currently riding, but his dream is not yet achieved until they make it to the end.

Franky usually acts tough and is quickly angered, but he is also very emotional when it comes to sad tales and often bursts into large tears, or on some occasions, plays a song. His most distinguishable personality trait is his flamboyant attitude. He frequently shouts the word 'SUPER' when he's in a positive mood, or adds it into his speech. He also has a signature pose which he uses very often.

Franky is quick to defend other people (e.g. Franky Family, Nico Robin) and take action if his friends are harmed. He is also quick in making friends, allies, and comrades with even the most unlikely of individuals. Because of this, he is seen as a 'big brother' figure. Monkey D. Luffy bears similar qualities (with the exception of engaging in unnecessary fights) and because of this, despite the disputes the two had in the past, both grew to respect each other during the events of the Enies Lobby Arc."
Jinbe;Jinbe  (ジンベエ);"Jinbe ""Knight of the Sea"" ";"
Jinbe is a whale shark fishman who was the second captain of the Sunny Pirates after Fisher Tiger, and who became a Shichibukai eight years ago. Jinbe's name comes from jinbei-zame (甚平鮫), which means ""whale shark"" in Japanese. His epithet, Kaikyou would normally translate into ""Strait"" or ""Channel"". However since the kanji for it is written as (海侠の) and not (海峡の), the kyou part (侠) of it comes from (任侠), a honorific used when addressing a high ranking yakuza member, thus making his epithet a Japanese pun.


During the Impel Down arc Jinbei refused to go to war with Whitebeard, getting himself locked up in Impel Down in the same cell as Ace. He then teams up with Luffy and the others to rescue Ace, and decided to give up his position as a Shichibukai.

Nanachi;Nanachi  (ナナチ);Nanachi  ;"
Nanachi is so-called ""Final Form""—a survivor of ascension from the sixth level of the Abyss. Madness and/or death are not uncommon results of such an attempt but, due to certain circumstances, Nanachi was able to keep their personality and mental faculties intact, their body, however, was deformed beyond recognition.

Nanachi is presumed to be female, although their sex is never expressly stated and talking about themself Nanachi uses gender-neutral pronoun ""oira.""

Not much is known about Nanachi's past—they were born in the Far North region of Sereni, lost their family and home at a young age and were taken to the Abyss by treachery.

Nanachi looks very young, but their vast knowledge of the physics and ecology of the Abyss seems to suggest they've lived there for quite a while. They also appear to be an accomplished healer with significant surgical skills and extensive knowledge of medicinal plants and such. Most of the time Nanachi is cool and reserved, keeping their distance both emotionally and physically. Their ironic attitude often borders on being sarcastic and even cynical, however behind this mask Nanachi hides a kind and gentle soul capable of deep compassion and selfless devotion.

Regu;Regu  (レグ);Regu  ;"
Regu is a robot who appears to be a little boy. His actual age, origins and even name are unknown since he can't recall anything about his life before the encounter with Riko. He was named Regu by Riko after a dog she used to have.

Regu's body is extremely durable and resistant to physical damage, it's also way lighter than its size would suggest. The arms could be extended for as far as 40 meters and each of them has a built-in Incinerator relic. These high-powered beam cannons are capable of reducing to ashes almost anything, however, Incinerators are weapons of last resort since even a single shot depletes the body's energy almost completely making Regu lose consciousness for 2 hours. Having an artificial body, Regu might be the only intelligent being completely immune to the Curse of the Abyss, because of that he is sometimes referred to as ""The Aubade"" aka ""The Treasure of the Deep.""

Despite being a formidable fighter Regu is rather shy and unassertive. He blushes easily and often cries when in distress. Unlike Riko, Regu is easily flustered by danger and has to rely on Riko's judgment in difficult situations.

Riko;Riko  (リコ);Riko  ;"
Riko is the only child of the legendary cave raider Lyza ""The Annihilator."" When Riko was two, her mother went missing during a quest to the bottom of the Abyss, since then Riko lived in Beruchoro Orphanage, studying to become a cave raider herself.

By the age of twelve she's attained the rank of an apprentice which gives her rights to wear a red whistle and explore the shallowest levels of the Abyss. She dreams of attaining the white whistle rank (the highest among cave raiders) and following her mother to the bottom of the Abyss.

Riko is a good-natured and energetic child. She has a quick and inquisitive mind and tries to gather and properly organize all the information available on the subjects that interest her. Riko is resilient and stubborn and although, due to the slight build, she's not much of a brawler, her ability to keep a cool head under pressure and make rational decisions in the heat of battle allows her to successfully tackle most dangers the Abyss has to offer. She's also very good at cooking.

Ouzen is a peerless fighter—her unique relic ""Thousand Pins"" grants her superhuman strength, speed, and longevity. (Even though Ouzen appears to be young, she attained the rank of a white whistle more than 50 years back.) She is over two meters tall and has a peculiar hairstyle which conceals the scalp deformations caused by the extended exposure to the Curse of the Abyss.

Ouzen has absolute control over her facial expressions, and her actual feelings (or lack thereof) cannot be guessed with any certainty. The reasons behind her actions are unknown as well—Ouzen rarely bothers to explain herself, and even when she does, it's impossible to know whether she's telling the truth or just toying with the audience.

Maruruk is a Delver that lives in ""Seeker Camp"" of the 2nd layer of The Abyss alongside the legendary white whistle Ouzen the Immovable. Despite his young age, he's already a Blue Whistle due to being a direct apprentice of a White Whistle.

At some point when he was very young he fell down on an accident and nearly lost his life before being rescued by Ouzen. Following the event, he chose to stay in the abyss and become Ouzen's disciple but after some time his eyes developed an extreme sensitivity to the light, so he never returned to the surface. He's in charge of the telescope on the camp, and is often keeping watch of the surroundings in case a delver shows up so that a gondola can be lowered ahead of time.

Maruruk is a young boy with short blue hair and a rounded face. His feminine traits and maid attire leads people to mistake him for a girl but he's actually male. While the details are not clear, it seems Ouzen was the one that forced him to dress like a maid.

Endo, Kenji;Kenji Endo (遠藤 健児);"Kenji ""Yabuki Joe"" Endo";"
Endo Kenji grew up in late-1960s/early-1970s Japan, at a time when American phenomena, notably the space race and the era of Woodstock, were resounding around the world. An avid reader of manga who often saw apocalyptic scenarios playing out, he always responded with the cry of ""I would fight!"" During this time, he and his friends made up a scenario for world conquest in order to play heroes.

Flash forward to 1997, a time where Kenji has taken charge of his families liquor shop and turned it into a convenience store. He is now raising the daughter of his sister, Kiriko (who disappeared immediately after leaving her daughter to Kenji), and living a fairly ordinary life. However, after events from the prophecy he made up earlier begin to come true, he learns of an evil organization, led by a masked man called ""Friend"", which is using his plans to conquer the world. As the organization's hold on the government strengthens, he becomes a wanted man and lives on the streets, continuing to (covertly) oppose Friend, partially through terrorism and partially through a protest song he wrote (named ""Bob Lennon"").


He supposedly died from an explosion on the Bloody New Year's Eve. However, he survives, although we do not know of any of his actions prior to meeting Damian Yoshida, guitarist of the band the Eroim Esseims, in 2014. It appears that he may have been suffering from amnesia at this time, as he identified himself as the devil (in a reference to the real life Blues legend of Robert Johnson, said to have influenced rock 'n' roll.) He then continued to wander Japan until the third year of the Friend era (the era in which Friend was declared president of the world), when a sudden surge of memory causes him to recall his identity. While heading to Tokyo, he meets up with old friend Konichi, now a radio DJ who, oblivious to Kenji's true identity, records his song (a version of ""Bob Lennon"" with modified lyrics) and subsequently broadcasts it on radio. As Kenji makes his way past border guards now under Friend's control, using charisma and song, he gains more and more of a following. Once he reaches Tokyo, he confronts Friend and watches him and another old friend, Sada Kiyoshi, die together in an explosion. Finally, he reunites with his old friends and niece, and there the story ends."

Born in 1580 in the Fuwa village and younger brother of Tsujikaze Tenma. His mom tried to kill him by pushing him off a waterfall the same way she did to Tsujikaze Tenma, however, Tenma kills her and takes Kōhei under his wing. Though Tenma showed him much kindness, Kōhei hardly displayed any affection. When the Tsujikaze Gang was formed and engaged in crimes ranging from robbery, rape, and extortion, Kōhei became its member at 12 and was considered most savage by others. At 12 Kōhei attempted to rape the wife of a villager he had slain, but Tenma, disgusted by the act, slew the woman to put her out of her misery and crushed Kōhei's testicles, rendering him (Kōhei) impotent.

Kōhei failed at killing Tenma and was imprisoned as punishment, during which time he came to adopt a nihilistic outlook on life. The Tsujikaze Gang failed to make a name for themselves and honor their employer, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, in attempting to capture Tokugawa Ieyasu. At the age of 20 in the year 1600, serving 7 years of imprisonment, Kōhei was released by surviving Sekigahara soldiers and escaped to hunt his brother ever since.

Originally desired to kill Tenma himself before Takezō got to him, Kōhei confronts Takezō only to have the battle postponed by Takezō’s captors; cuts the rope by which Takezō is suspended. Kōhei as a bandit came to be referred to as the 'God of Death' and killed Shishido Baiken, master of the kusarigama though revealed to be little more than the leader of a small band of thieves. Pretending to be Baiken, Kōhei lived with a little girl, Rindo, who also wielded the kusarigama and was actually his teacher in using it. He is challenged by Musashi and loses, yet his life is spared, though he loses some fingers on his left hand.

While recuperating he recalls that Sasaki Kojiro smashed his pride by being further ""along the path of death"" than him. It has recently been revealed that Kojiro was the one who gave Kohei his disfiguring facial scar.

Huan Yi is a Vice General who serves in Great General Mou Gou's army. In the past, he was a bandit leader with the moniker Huan Yi the Beheader.

His personality is said to be extremely brutal as he has no qualms in killing surrendered soldiers and personally beheaded every person in any city or village he conquered. This is shown in how he sends Wei soldiers, who have been severely tortured, along with bags of eyeballs back to their camp to decrease morale and incite fear.

He always has an arrogant smirk on his face and talks in a crude manner at times. He shows no respect for his foes as he calls Gen Bou ""an old fart"" and ""trash"" before killing him. He is exhibits a sense of humor and sarcasm as in the case when a fellow crew member asked him why he made an unskilled man named Ogiko as 1000-man commander of The Huan Yi army, he replied ""Gyahaha cause it's funny obviously.""

He also has a cool demeanor and almost never displays any shock no matter how bad the situation is. Huan Yi also shows a very dark side as he toys with Haku Kisai by dangling the idea of escape from death if he begged for his life then stabbed him several times after he refused to grovel.

He does exhibits a sense of loyalty exclusive to Mou Gou by holding the rank of Vice General in his army and coming when summoned as demonstrated when Chou Tou used Mou Gou's name, as he knew that Huan Yi would simply ignore an request for a conversation with him.

Sakuragi, Hanamichi;Hanamichi Sakuragi (桜木 花道);"Hanamichi ""Tensai Baskettoman, The Rebound King"" Sakuragi";"
Height: 189.2 cm
Weight: 83 kg
Jersey Number: #10
Position: Power Forward
Birthday: April 1
High School: Shohoku

The protagonist. At the beginning of the series, Sakuragi was a slacker, always trying to ask girls out but getting constantly rejected (the 50th rejection occurring at the start of the series). He then met Akagi Haruko, with whom he fell in love immediately. This passion led to him joining the Shohoku basketball team. However, as a complete beginner, he was not able to keep up with the rest of the team at first despite his physical attributes (great height, athleticism, stamina, speed and leaping ability). He regards himself as a genius though, with self-confidence that borders on arrogance. His most recognizable trait is his red hair, though he shaves his head as reparation for an error that led to the loss against Kainan.

At first, Sakuragi was known for his poor basketball skills as a beginner; in his first few official matches, he fouled out every game. However, his basketball skills advanced throughout the series. First he developed his basic skills, such as dribbling and layups. Then, trained by Akagi, he became a formidable rebounder; his rebounding became his claim to fame throughout the latter half of the series. He also is seen more than once defining the match for Shohoku in the last seconds, for instance, by dunking a ball that Akagi would have missed in the league round match with Ryonan. His jump shooting was then developed by Coach Anzai, who had him make 20,000 shots in a week. He hit a buzzer-beating jump shot to win the match against Sannoh. However, he also injured his back during the match against Sannoh, and underwent rehabilitation after Shohoku's subsequent loss to Aiwa Academy.

In spite of the setbacks he has had to face, Sakuragi displays a great deal of tenacity and determination that carry him through and help reciprocate for his other failings, both on and off the court. Although his love for Haruko and rivalry with Rukawa are the main driving forces motivating him to succeed in basketball, his injury during the Sannoh match makes him realize that he has actually come to love the game, leading him to give his all for his team and bring them victory.

Jersey No: 11
Position: Small Forward, SF

High School: Shohoku High School (Freshman)
Grade: 10
Class: 1
Junior High School: Tomigaoka Junior High

Kaede Rukawa is Sakuragi's rival as well as almost his opposite; he is attractive to girls, skilled at basketball, and very cold and unfeeling. The only traits they share are that they are not academically inclined and good fighters. He regards Sakuragi as an idiot and both normally fight. Actually, he knows Sakuragi can put his talents to a better use, but is ashamed to see the immaturity with which he deals with things. His hobby is sleeping, and is usually seen asleep whenever he's not on the court; he can even ride his bike while asleep often crashing with objects when doing so. Waking Rukawa from a nap is considered unforgivable, since he will almost automatically beat up the culprit. Unsurprisingly, he has also been in his fair share of off-court fights, but can hold his own. Rukawa's goal is to be the best high school player in Japan, and he considers Sendoh of Ryonan to be his greatest rival. A fact being that he is often nicknamed the ""super-rookie"", the ""ace of Shohoku"", even.

Rukawa is extremely good at basketball, and possesses a wide range of skills to complement his height, athleticism and drive to win. Despite being merely a first-year high school player, he is the undisputed ace of Shohoku's team. In the Kanagawa Interhigh Tournament, he was named one of the top five players, the only first year player so honored. He has managed to change the course of many games, such as when he single-handedly brought Shohoku back from a double-digit deficit against Kainan (Rukawa scored 15 straight points for Shohoku in 2 minutes and 5 seconds just before the end of the first half). However, his style was criticized as being too selfish, and he sometimes comes into conflict with his teammates for various reasons; this was one of the reasons why Coach Anzai refused to give him his blessing when Rukawa told him that he intended to go to the USA, and told him to become the best in Japan before he even thought of it. When he was outplayed by Sawakita during the match against Sannoh Technical, though, he realized what Sendoh reminded him as a challenge: To defeat Sendoh, Rukawa had to change his style and pass the ball. It was his pass that led to Hanamichi's buzzer-beating shot, winning the match. Rukawa is subsequently named a member of the All-Japan basketball team.

Mitsui, Hisashi;Hisashi Mitsui (三井 寿);"Hisashi ""Mitch, Mit-chin"" Mitsui";"

Height: 184 (6 ft ½ in)
Weight: 70 kg (154 lb)
Shoe brand: Asics
Jersey number: 14
Position: Shooting Guard, SG

Before joining Shohoku, Mitsui Hisashi was an MVP for Takeishi Junior High. Despite having opportunities to join more prestigious high schools like Ryonan, he choose to go to Shohoku because of Coach Anzai; Anzai had given him the courage to win in the Junior High tournament by encouraging him during the last seconds of the match. However, an injury to his left knee in a training session interrupted his basketball career. An imprudent early return to the basketball court reinjured the knee more severely, leading to a basketball hiatus of over a year.

Although he eventually healed, he was embittered by his exclusion from the court, and Mitsui quit basketball and became the leader of a gang. His gang got in a fight with Miyagi, and during the fight, Miyagi beat Mitsui senseless before taking a beating himself.

Afterwards, Mitsui attempted to ruin the basketball team by instigating them into fighting with his gang, as the team would have been banned from competition for fighting. In the end, Sakuragi's own gang—Yohei, Takamiya, Ookusu and Noma—voluntarily took the blame for the fight, and Mitsui was filled with remorse when he saw Anzai again. He rejoined the team and vowed never to fight again.

Mitsui is best known on the team as a three-point specialist, though his skills extend to other areas; during a practice match, he once managed to shut down Sakuragi, playing center. His defensive ability completely shut down Fukuda's scoring abilities. His three-pointers helped Shohoku catch up when they were 12 points down against Shoyo, and again when the team was 20 points down against Sannoh in the National Championships. His greatest weakness, though, is his lack of stamina due to his long break from playing basketball. Thus, in the latter halves of games, he has not always been as reliable—he missed a potential game-winning shot against Kainan and collapsed on-court during the game against Ryonan.

Weight: 59 kg (130 lbs.)
Position: point guard (PG)
Jersey no.: 7
Shoe Brand: Converse

There is not much known about Miyagi's background. He joined the basketball team for his love for the game in the first place. But soon it seems that he is also playing for the love of his life Ayako, the team manager. Although Ryonan's coach asked him to join the Ryonan Basketball Team, Miyagi chose for Shohoku because of Anzai. Miyagi is a problem kid, he gets into fights a lot and got himself beaten up. He was also the one who beat Mitsui up, but he had to pay the price of staying in the hospital for some time...

Miyagi is quite short, but he has the greatest speed of all players mentioned in Slam Dunk. He has a great dribble and combined with his speed he's able to tear up the opponent's defense and deliver excellent (no-look) passes to the free team mate. He's also able to get a score at his own powers and his steals are just marvelous. Miyagi is a good point guard with a great sight on the game, he's also able to find his team mates without looking for them. He's the strategist of the team, and thanks to this role and his own skills he becomes the next team captain as Akagi retires to focus on exams. By the way, he is also a good street fighter and has a very good flying kick. (Mitsui told)

Coach Anzai says that Miyagi's value to the team is his great speed and his keen senses.

Miyagi is a smart but kind of rude person, who is only nice and sweet to Ayako... He tried to date other girls to forget Ayako, but he failed to. So he can be a very sensitive person too. In the beginning he mistook Sakuragi for Ayako's boyfriend and got into a fight with him immediately. Later when they found out about each other's painful roads of love, they feel sympathy for each other and start to get along. That's how they became good friends. Miyagi is a bit short tempered sometimes and hates when people make fun of his height. In the match vs Toyotama he gets angry with the opposing point guard, loses his view on the game and almost beats the guy. But in the second half he is able to remain calm again and show his true powers.

Year: 3rd Year
Height: 197 cm
Weight: 90 kg
Jersey Number: #4
Position: Center

Takenori Akagi is the captain of the Shohoku basketball team and Haruko's older brother. Despite at first not thinking too much of Sakuragi (who addresses him as ""Gori"" for gorilla due to his immense physical presence), he actually realizes Sakuragi's potential as a basketball player. Serious and disciplined, Akagi's dream is to lead Shohoku to the national championship. His determination is shown in the match against Kainan, where he played on despite a serious injury to his ankle. Akagi considers Uozumi of Ryonan to be his biggest rival, though their rivalry is not antagonistic; indeed, there is respect that borders on friendship.

Akagi differs from the other starters in two respects. First, he is the most academically talented out of all them and is considered a model student. After the loss to Aiwa knocks Shohoku out of the Nationals, Akagi leaves the team along with Kogure to study for the college entrance exams. In contrast, the other four had to beg their teacher to be given the chance to retake some exams they had flunked; they would otherwise have been disqualified from playing in the Nationals for having failed too many classes. Second, Akagi is the only starter not to have gotten into an actual fight, although he has used physical force against his own players (most notably Sakuragi, and once Mitsui after the gym fight) to keep them in line. He is the only other character besides Rukawa able to take one of Sakuragi's trademark headbutts without being knocked out and the only other character who has had Sakuragi inadvertently dunk a ball on his head (Murasame of Miuradai was the second, in the manga; in the anime, the second one to be dunked on the head is Naito, also from Miuradai).

Regarded as the best center in the Kanagawa prefecture, Akagi plays as a fairly typical center, using his height and power to score close to the basket. He also has a reputation for being a virtually unbeatable defender. As captain of the team, he keeps discipline among his players during matches. Akagi met his match during the game against Sannoh, in the form of Masashi Kawata, considered one of the best centers at the high school level. Initially intimidated when Kawata outplayed him, he regained his confidence thanks to Uozumi's encouragement and led his team to victory.

Weight: 79 kg (174 lbs.)
Position: point guard (PG) and small forward (SF)
Jersey no.: 7
Shoe Brand: Converse

Sendou is in contrary to most of the Slam Dunk characters a very nice and warm person. He always smiles and is friendly and modest, although he surely knows that he is a more than marvelous player. He never loses his temper and shows respect to strong players, but definitely won't give away any game! He's a fighter for victory no matter what. The only problem he might have is his lack of focus when he meets an opponent that's not very strong. His concentration is optimal when he's playing rivals such as Rukawa and Maki; such guys bring up the best in him.

Sendou is a good shooter, nice rebounder and also a strategist of the game. He's able to play fancy offense but also great defense to stop outstanding forwards such as Rukawa. Despite his height he's a very speedy and flexible player. He ain't the Genius for nothing. Sakuragi likes to call himself the Genius, but Sendou is called the true Genius by others.

In his first year of high school he was a small forward and literally a scoring machine (similarity with Rukawa), but in his second year he figured the fun of passing the ball and upgraded the whole team. His sight on the game is outstanding and his senses are very high; thanks to these facts he became the excellent point guard of the team, which is quite exceptional for such a tall player. But he does his job very well and is without a doubt the ace player of Ryonan. Along with Fukuda and Uozumi they form the strongest offense of Kanagawa.

Not only is he the ace player, he's also the mental support of the team, when things are going wrong, the team members keep having faith in their star player. Sendou is the kind of player that can bring up the best qualities of others. He's a reliable player: when the team is behind, he'll show his scoring ability again without losing the focus on the game. He knows what the best is for his team. It's often said that Sendou is the true captain of Ryonan instead of Uozumi, because he has the ability to calm down the team, and also fire up and unify the team. When Uozumi retires from the game Sendou becomes the new captain."

Haruko is Takenori's younger sister and Sakuragi's love interest. Sweet and with a captivating personality, Haruko is always around to cheer on the players, especially her brother Takenori (who is extremely protective of her and taught her the basics of basketball) and Sakuragi, whom she considers as her best friend. Haruko often appears at matches together with Sakuragi's cohorts and her two best friends, Fujii and Matsui. She, like most girls in Shohoku High, only has eyes for Kaede, although he never reciprocates her feelings and, later in the anime, she acknowledges that he won't love her the way she wants him to and tries to let go of her crush, however not successful.

Haruko was responsible for uncovering Sakuragi's athletic talent after seeing him try to dunk a ball at her request - she was impressed by the height of his jump and considered him good enough to join the team. Hanamichi always listens to Haruko, due to his deep affection for her. They have gone on some (what Sakuragi considers) non-official dates and have occasionally trained together.

Despite her emotional denseness and sweetness, Haruko is a pretty good student (she helped Akagi tutor Sakuragi and the other three starters when they had to retake some tests) and is not afraid to stand up for others when needed. She confronted Sakuragi when she mistakenly thought that he had attacked Rukawa, and she also defended him many times from Kaede's most rabid fangirls (one of them even knocked her to the ground in the anime series).

Anzai, Mitsuyoshi;Mitsuyoshi Anzai (安西 光義);"Mitsuyoshi ""White-Haired Buddha"" Anzai";"
The coach of the Shohoku High basketball team, and one of the best ones in Japan. Even the coaches of other teams call him ""Anzai-sensei"" with respect. His calm and collected attitude contrasts with the temper he had in the past, when he was nicknameed ""White-Haired Devil"" as a demanding college coach.

A talented player, Ryuji Yazawa, trained under him and was eyed with high regard by Anzai. However, Yazawa was unhappy about Anzai's tough training for him (especially the repetitive and strenuous basic technique training), and against the Coach's wish, left Japan to play in the USA, where he thought he would have better opportunities to show his talent. 5 years passed without any news, other than an unaddressed video tape showing Yazawa playing in a team, whose players had virtually no concepts of teamwork. One day Anzai learned from the press that Yazawa died in a high-speed head-on car collision, reportedly under drug influence. While visiting Yazawa's grave, Yazawa's mother gave Anzai a letter written 4 years prior, which Yazawa never had the courage to post back. In the letter, Yazawa expressed profound regret about his rebellious decision to leave, and the depression from his experience in the unsupportive American college basketball career. Anzai grieved deeply for the loss of Yazawa and resigned from college basketball coaching ever since. This also changed Anzai's former strict attitude to his now mild temper, for which he is now known as the ""White-Haired Buddha.""

Sakuragi always calls Coach Anzai ""Oyaji"" (old man) and has the habit of jiggling his fat when hyped, which makes the others - Mitsui in particular - mad at him, as this is considered disrespectful. Anzai, however, appears to tolerate this and has not reprimanded Sakuragi for his behavior. However, Anzai did punish the four players (Mitsui, Miyagi, Sakuragi and Rukawa) involved in the fight against Mitsui's gang, by initially benching them during the first interhigh tournament match against Miuradai High School.

However behind such an impassible demeanor is a brilliant strategist, who always knows how to turn the tide of a match for his team. Anzai like Haruko Akagi, realized Sakuragi's potential early on and decided to make him a starter even though some of his basketball skills were not yet par. Recognizing that shooting was Sakuragi's weakness, he made him make 20,000 baskets in a week to get ready for the national tournament. Anzai is also very charismatic and able to inspire his players to greater heights, as evidenced before the match against Sannoh, where he managed to bring down the insecurity within Miyagi, Mitsui and, to a lesser extent, Sakuragi. Although they were directly recruited by Coach Moichi Taoka of Ryonan, both Mitsui and Ryota turned him down, citing Anzai's presence at Shohoku as the primary factor. Mitsui respects Anzai the most, and once put a picture of him on the bench and prayed to it when Anzai was unable to come to the inter-high Shohoku-Ryonan match due to heart attack.

Kenji Fujima is the player/coach of Shoyo High. As such, he only enters the court when is presence is really needed, such as when the team is behind and struggling. Fujima is so respected by his teammates that as much as possible they try not to make it necessary for him to get on the court, and even the hint of his getting off the bench to join them inspires them to play harder. His personality also varies depending on which role he is playing in the game; as a coach and off the court, he is calm, mild-mannered and friendly (he even personally deals with his fangirls and is very kind to them), but he becomes confident, high-spirited and even ruthless when he's on court. As Maki says in volume #10, ""As a player, he's far from rational.""

Fujima plays as a typical point guard, leading his team and passing the ball, but also shooting and scoring when necessary. He is one of the top point guards in the Kanagawa prefecture and a force to be reckoned with on the court.

Fujima is referenced during the first round of the National Championships when Shohoku plays against Toyotama High School. Toyotama's captain, Tsuyoshi Minami, known as the ""Ace Killer"" injured Fujima in a match resulting in his removal from the game due to his injury. Subsequently, Shoyo lost the match to Toyotama."

Birthday: July 7

Weight: 45 kg

5 kg when she was under the influence of the heavy crab.
Hitagi, the main female character of
Bakemonogatari
, is a weak-looking girl with an ""incurable disease."" She is in the same class as Koyomi, but he has almost never heard her speak. When she was in the first year of high school, she encountered a mysterious crab, after which she became nearly weightless. Ever since then, she has avoided contact with everyone else, threatening everyone who discovers her secret. She called herself a tsundere and always speaks in an abusive style.


At the end of Mayoi Snail, she admits that she loves Koyomi, and subsequently enters into a relationship with him. After the events in Tsukihi Phoenix, she overcomes all of her trauma, and becomes a rather cheerful and normal girl. She starts calling Araragi with a cute nickname, chuckling at small things and sending e-mails full of emoticons, although her sharp tongue is still there, but toned down. She also seems to have a father complex as she becomes excited to the point of being unable to fall asleep when using her father's blanket."

She appears to be an eight-year-old girl, but she was originally a beautiful vampire who had lived for more than 500 years. At the end of events of Koyomi Vamp, after Koyomi realizes that having saved his master from a certain death, leaded to a future where she will kill humans (the ""portable food"" she calls them) to ensure her survival, Koyomi revolts against Kissshot in a bloody battle to death, where Kissshot chooses not to use her full powers (in order to have a proper battle with her servant). Later on the battle it is revealed that she pretended to turn Koyomi into a human again, by letting herself be killed by Koyomi. After the shocking revelation, he cannot bring himself to kill his master who was giving her life for his, and who cared for him at the point of risking her life to save his (from sunburn) at the beginning of Spring's Break. But to prevent herself from eating more humans, Koyomi asked for help to Oshino Meme, who in the end tells that as a happy ending won't be possible for everyone, then everyone will have an unhappy ending! While Koyomi himself cannot return to be a fully human, Kissshot Acerolaorion Heartunderblade was left in a weakened condition (where she is no longer able to eat humans, and needs her servant's blood to survive) with no powers or traces of her original personality and therefore have to abandon her ""Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade"" (キスショット・アセロラオリオン・ハートアンダーブレード) name. Ever since ""Tsubasa Cat"" where she starts living in Araragi's shadow, she no longer needs to suck his blood on a regular basis in order to stay alive. She forms a physical connection with Araragi where they can feel each others emotions and senses. It is also later revealed that she can gain strength into an ""evolved"" form after sucking Araragi's blood more than the usual dosage, she does this in order to fight for Araragi when he confronts Yotsugi and Yozuru. In Mayoi Jiangshi, in the alternate timeline, Shinobu went berserk when Koyomi was killed by Black Hanekawa, feeling that she was somewhat responsible for his death, so she swore to destroy the world and created the Jiangshi that has been swarming the town. It seems that she truly cares about Koyomi and when she saw Koyomi was alive in the alternate timeline, she started weeping blood. In the end, Araragi simply states that he will die together with Shinobu. Her father named her Lola, however she went by the name Acerola.

Araragi, Koyomi;Koyomi Araragi (阿良々木 暦);"Koyomi ""Koyokoyo, Koyomin"" Araragi";"
Age: 18
Height: 165 cm
Weight: 55 kg

Koyomi Araragi is a third year high school student who survived a vampire attack during spring break and barely regained his human life in the time that followed as a boy with remnants of vampiric traits. He can see in the dark, his eyes turn red when he gets angry, and he heals incredibly fast. As a result, he questions his lifespan. He remains scared of morning sunlight despite the fact that it no longer has any negative effects on him.

Koyomi is a laid-back person whose only real friend at school is Tsubasa Hanekawa. He's a poor student, close to failing every class except math.

It is revealed through conversations that he's quite knowledgeable with anime; a fact even noted by Nadeko Sengoku once.

Although he is shown to be attracted to the other girls, he turns their advances down due to his loyalty to Hitagi.

Other characters seems to speculate that Koyomi is a lolicon, particularly Mayoi and Hitagi, with Hitagi thinking that Nadeko is a ""threat"" to her.

He is very noble, which is why Hitagi is attracted to him. He is willing to help others at the cost of his own life. As such, the female characters he has helped are quite attached to him. He feels most comfortable talking to Mayoi, Shinobu and, from the Second Season on, to Yotsugi about his problems.

Koyomi is the only person who thinks that his family relationship is bad, with Karen and Tsukihi thinking otherwise. His parents were revealed to be police officers.

His personality is portrayed more clearly in the novels, where his inner thoughts show him to be much more perverted and intelligent than the anime leads one to believe.

Due to events prior to
Kizumonogatari
and
Bakemonogatari
, Koyomi avoided having friends and seemed to have lost faith and trust in people and himself.

Height: 158cm

Favorite phrase/slogan: ""I don't know everything, I just know what I know."" (何でもは知らないわよ。知ってることだけ。, Nandemo wa shiranaiwa yo. Shitteru koto dake.)

She styles her hair into two braids and ties them with a hair ribbon that has a cat design. She is always seen dressed in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, even outside of school days, and is rarely seen on any other type of clothing, except for a set of sleepwear which she wore during Tsubasa Cat Arc.

Hanekawa Tsubasa is Araragi's classmate and the class president. Araragi describes her as ""the class president of all class presidents."" The reason Tsubasa and Hitagi cut their hair short is because they learned Araragi likes it short.

Hanekawa currently lives with her stepfather and stepmother.


Hanekawa Family's Past:

Her biological mother was 17 years old when she got pregnant, the biological father is unknown because she apparently had many lovers. Before she gave birth to Tsubasa, she married another man who was a ""workaholic."" Right after giving birth, Tsubasa's biological mother commited suicide. The workaholic stepfather, unable to raise a child, remarried again to a woman who is Tsubasa's current mother. The workaholic father soon died from overwork and the current mother married another man who is now Tsubasa's current father.

Hanekawa Story's overview in Nekomonogatari/Bakemonogatari:

Prior to the beginning of Bakemonogatari Hanekawa was possessed by a bakeneko (mischievous spirit of a dead cat) during Golden Week due to stress over her family (see Nekomonogatari: Kuro). The matter was eventually resolved with the help of Shinobu at the cost of some of Hanekawa's memories, but the problem emerged again right before the school festival because of different stress. Araragi was told by Hanekawa's bakeneko form that she has feelings for him. In ""Tsubasa Tiger"" (Nekomonogatari: Shiro), on her way to school, she met a tiger spirit which spoke to her. Soon buildings important to Hanekawa began to mysteriously burn down and ""Black Hanekawa"" (her bakeneko form) began to take over her body every time she slept. The inevitable showdown was afoot and led to some surprising events. ""Tsubasa Tiger"" is written from the perspective of Hanekawa rather than Araragi."
Hachikuji, Mayoi;Mayoi Hachikuji (八九寺 真宵);"Mayoi ""Hachihachiji, Hachirokuji"" Hachikuji";"
Mayoi is a fifth-grade elementary school girl. She is 144cm tall and always carries a big backpack, wears a hairband, and sports ponytails. Befitting her age, Mayoi is cheerful, energetic and inquisitive. She makes a lot of spelling mistakes and has a habit of mispronouncing Koyomi's family name. On the other hand, she does not easily trust strangers, and will even fight back against them if they become too nosy.


Ten years ago she was involved in a traffic accident and died because of it. After that she became a ghost and considers herself a ""lost snail"". She unwillingly causes the people around her to become lost and unable to find their way home. The only people who can see her are people who don't want to go home in the first place. However, after Araragi and Senjougahara help her find the home she was looking for, she changed from an ""earthbound spirit"" to a ""wandering spirit"", a fact that she considers to be a bonus, as well as granting her to be free to wander wherever she desires. At the end of Nisemonogatari, she said goodbye to Koyomi, implying that she will not be seeing him again, which will be the basis of the next story, Mayoi Jiangshi. Her family name before her parents got divorced was Tsunade.

In Shinobu Time, she is chased by the darkness together with Koyomi Araragi. It is later revealed by Izuko Gaen that the darkness was targeting Hachikuji because she remained in the town even after she was saved by Koyomi. To stop the darkness, she finally decides that she must pass on. She kisses Koyomi and confesses her love for him before she vanishes."
Kanbaru, Suruga;Suruga Kanbaru (神原 駿河);Suruga  Kanbaru;"
Suruga, the main character of Suruga Monkey, is Koyomi's underclassman, star of the school's basketball team and one of Hitagi's acquaintances from back in junior high school. She is so well known in her school that not a single student had not heard of her, mostly because it was her who was responsible of the rapid rise of success of the school's girls basketball team due to her talents. She considers herself a lesbian, fujoshi, lolicon and masochist. Her hobbies include reading yaoi literature and playing basketball. Although her sexual preference is clearly towards females, she does not have a hard time interacting with males, and she even manages to say teasing remarks when she is comfortable with the person she talks to (i.e. Araragi). She is 160cm tall.

Suruga is a girl with brown eyes and dark bluish hair. Because of her club activities as a basketball varsity player, she boasts an athletic physique, although she admits that her breasts might not be ample enough for Araragi to notice.

Her clothing style reflects her boyish personality; when she is not in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, she often wears sleeveless clothing and shorts. Whichever clothes she wears, she is regularly seen wearing cycling shorts, which she considers to be her underwear, much to Araragi's shock upon hearing it straight from her (as it implies that she does not wear panties).


Hidden from others, however, is her tendency to be jealous of others to the point of thinking of causing bodily harm to them for revenge. This would eventually fuel her killing intent as the Rainy Devil. Back in elementary school, she inherited what she thought was a monkey's paw. At this time, she had been teased at for being slow in track. Because of this, Suruga decides to use the monkey's paw to grant her wish to become the fastest among her classmates. Unexpectedly, her competitors in one race she would participate in were attacked by an unknown assailant and were absent the next day. This would soon continue for some time, and this caused Suruga to be afraid, especially upon her discovery of the novel The Monkey's Paw, which tells the story of a similar item that grants wishes for a certain price. Suruga would soon shift her focus to basketball, where she immediately shone as the school's ace player, and this caused Hitagi Senjougahara, the track ace at that time, to take notice of her talent. She and Hitagi become close friends,with Kanbaru calling their pairing the Valhalla Combo (ヴァルハラコンビ Varuhara Konbi, formed by the ""varu"" from Kanbaru and ""hara"" from Senjougahara), and she soon forgot about the monkey's paw. Immediately after she entered senior high school, she became aware of Hitagi's secret and was threatened by her, just like Koyomi was. However, unlike the persistent Araragi, Kanbaru followed Hitagi's advice and stopped talking to Hitagi since that time. However, she then started stalking Koyomi after she discovered he was dating Hitagi. In Suruga Devil, there seems to be a rumor about a devil solving other people's problem. Fearing that she might be the rumored ""Devil,"" she decided to investigate and found out that the rumored Devil is actually an old basketball rival of hers named, Numachi Rouka. It seems that Kanbaru is still worried about the effects of the Rainy Devil after it has been dispersed to the point that whenever she goes to sleep, she would bind her devil's arm to a pillar so that she wouldn't start sleepwalking and committing crimes and check the newspaper everyday so that she can make sure she didn't do anything unconsciously. She also has dreams of her mother once in a while which give her weird life lessons. She is named Kanbaru Suruga now but she was previously named Gaen Suruga. Izuko is her aunt and Suruga's mother had some kind of connection to oddities as she had inherited that devil's left arm from her mother. Her mother and father were revealed to have eloped as the Kanbaru family did not agree with their relationship. Kanbaru is also the only person that Kaiki will ever treat in a good way.

Favorite food: hamburger, yakisoba

Favorite color: purple

Obs: right-handed, 2° grade.

Nadeko, the main character of Nadeko Snake, is Tsukihi's friend back in elementary school. She always wears a waist pouch, always casts her eyes downward, has her bangs covering her eyes, has a shy personality, and can be easily amused. Koyomi played with her a lot whenever she visited his house after being invited by his sisters. She refers to Koyomi as Koyomi onii-chan and appears to have feelings for him.


She was cursed two times by a classmate who liked the boy she rejected, and the rejected boy. While the first one is banished, Koyomi is forced to battle the second to keep it from killing Nadeko.
She's quite protective of her hair (particularly her forelocks) thinking that it's her place to guard more than her panties. When she finally combed her forelocks aside in Nisemonogatari, Koyomi commented that she has a glare just like a serpent, probably foreshadowing the story of Nadeko Medusa.


Nadeko Medusa Arc

During Halloween, Nadeko met a girl named Ougi who gave her a white scrunchie. After, she was able to see a white serpent, Kuchinawa, in the place of it. In Nadeko's class, the atmosphere has become strained and because Nadeko is the class rep, she's been pressured to do something about it. Later on, Kuchinawa tells her to go to the shrine where she last sacrificed snakes in Bakemonogatari. He commands her to atone for what she did by finding the remains of the snake god that inhabited the shrine in the past. She tries not to involve Koyomi, but he manages to find her at night and takes her to his house. She wakes up next to Tsukihi and manages to bring up the topic of Koyomi's girlfriend. Finally, Nadeko reveals her jealousy toward Hitagi, but claims that she would never try to steal him. Tsukihi says that she planned to support her if Nadeko was going to do so. However, since Nadeko instead said she doesn't want to trouble him, Tsukihi says it's as if after all these years passed, that Nadeko is using her brother as in excuse to reject boys from her school. Tsukihi loses her patience and suddenly cuts Nadeko's fringe. This way, she wouldn't be able to hide her face or emotions anymore, which she later attempts again with her teacher. Yet without her fringe, he can see that she isn't disturbed at all. Nadeko ended up very ""uncharistically"" snapping at him and after, to her classmates. The serpent then tells Nadeko that its remains are in Araragi's house, where she finds the paper charm Gaen previously trusted Koyomi with. Kuchinawa offers to grant Nadeko any wish, and she already knows what to ask for: Koyomi to love her back. She says this in front of him, but he says that her desire cannot be granted. After some of Shinobu's provocation, Nadeko eats the charm and becomes an oddity, sharing her body with Kuchinawa, and her hair turns white with each lock becoming a snake. As an oddity, Nadeko reveals her true colors: an obsessive, egotistical, cynical girl, who would not hesitate to kill in order to keep her delusional and impossible love story."

Karen, the main character of Karen Bee, is one of Koyomi's sisters. She is older than Tsukihi and always doing outdoor activities. Despite being younger, Karen is taller than Koyomi, much to Koyomi's dismay.


In Karen Bee, her hot-headed personality and her habit of acting before thinking lead her to be stung by a bee which leads to being poisoned with a terrible fever that lasted for 3 days. Like Hitagi, she refused any help from anyone which eventually leads to her and Koyomi fighting each other. Later it was revealed that it was set up by Kaiki. Karen and Tsukihi are nicknamed Tsuga no Ki Nichū no Fire Sisters (栂の木二中のファイヤーシスターズ, lit. Fire Sisters of Tsuga no Ki 2nd Junior High). It was revealed that the reason she and Tsukihi found boyfriends was so that Koyomi would become jealous. They found boyfriends in Koyomi's image with Karen's boyfriend being shorter than her. She and Tsukihi also thought that Koyomi's girlfriend was Tsubasa. Koyomi, Karen and Tsukihi's parents were revealed to be police officers.

Kagenui believed the Tsukihi was a phoenix, but she is actually the reincarnation of a supernatural cuckoo called the ""Dying Bird."" The Dying Bird reincarnates by entering the body of a child still in the womb. She is immortal and the only thing that will end her life is a natural death from old age.

Kaiki, Deishuu;Deishuu Kaiki (貝木 泥舟);"Deishuu ""Suzuki"" Kaiki";"
Kaiki Deishuu is a conman specializing in fake apparitions.

Kaiki has a gloomy personality and subscribes to the view that there is nothing in the world that is inherently true. The only absolute in life for him is money, due to its value in providing anything he wants that isn't irreplaceable; he even believes it can readily buy concepts like love and happiness. An adept schemer, Kaiki has an opaque mind to outsiders. He is fluent in the arts of lying and subterfuge, so the reasoning behind what he says is constantly blurred. He explains his name as ""Kai,"" like a mound of clam shells, and ""Ki,"" like a dead tree.

Kaiki is an individual who prides himself in having no pride. He openly admits to being a conman and an impostor, among other things, but often this is to his advantage as a master of wordplay. He flows easily in his interactions with others, and he is willing to give and take in order to maximize profit or cut his losses as needed.

Kaiki is a fake specialist who knows about paranormal creatures, but does not personally believe in them. Instead, he manipulates those who do believe, using his knowledge to make money off of them.


In ""Nisemonogatari"" he serves as the main antagonist of the ""Karen Bee"" arc. He is identified as the one who swindled the Senjougahara family, as well as the one distributing charms among junior students of Naoetsu High School throughout ""Bakemonogatari"" and ""Nisemonogatari."" Confronted by Karen Araragi for his actions, Kaiki uses a bee apparition to incapacitate her and leaves. He is confronted in the arc's finale by Araragi Koyomi and Senjougahara Hitagi, who demand he cure Karen's curse and leave town for good. Kaiki claims that the bee apparition was a fake, a simple trick of hypnosis, and that whatever symptoms she is suffering will pass in a matter of days. He then agrees to their demands and decides to leave the town for good, though not before some choice words to Senjougahara. It is later revealed in the ""Tsukihi Phoenix"" arc that he was a colleague of Kagenui Yozuru and Oshino Meme during their days in university, having supplied the former information regarding Araragi Tsukihi.

In ""Monogatari Series: Second Season,"" he serves as the narrator and main protagonist in ""Koimonogatari."" He is hired in secret by Senjougahara to deceive the human-turned-snake god, Sengoku Nadeko, who had vowed to kill Araragi and his loved ones. Despite being prompted by Gaen Izuko to back out, Kaiki persists and narrowly succeeds in convincing Nadeko to give up her godhood and attachment to Araragi by appealing to her (well-hidden) former dream of becoming a mangaka. During the arc's resolution, just as he is about to leave town he is attacked by one of the junior high students that he scammed in ""Nisemonogatari,"" evidently tipped off by Oshino Ougi and implied to be the same student that had previously cursed Nadeko with a snake apparition.

Having survived the attack, Kaiki meets with Kanbaru Suruga during the events of ""Hanamonogatari,"" where he reveals that the ""woman of his dreams"" was Kanbaru's mother, Gaen Tooe. Gaen entrusted Kaiki with Suruga's well-being before she died; in honor of this promise, Kanbaru is the only one whom Kaiki shows unconditional kindness and never attempts to swindle. He offers Kanbaru his card—with the usual ""ghost buster"" moniker scratched off—and tells her to call him if she's ever in need. Not long afterward he sends her the mummified devil's head, which he claims was given to him by Gaen."

Hair Color: Black
Eye Color: Grey
Blood type: A
Occupation: high school student, member of Service Club
Affiliation: Sobu High School

Hachiman is the story's main protagonist, an isolated, friendless boy who is pragmatic to a fault. His most prominent feature is his set of ""dead fish-eyes."" He firmly believes that ""youth"" is simply an illusion created by hypocrites, for hypocrites, born from the ashes of past failures. In this state of apparent corruption, he is coerced into joining the Service Club by his futures advisor in the hopes that exposing him to the world will change his personality, and ultimately make him a ""better person."" He is called ""Hikki"" affectionately by Yui.

Yukino is the leader of the Service Club, of which she is the sole member until Hachiman joins her. She is smart, beautiful, and is nicknamed the ""Ice-cold Beauty"" for her icy demeanor. She has a twisted sense of ""noblesse oblige,"" and believes that it is the duty of the exceptional (in other words, herself) to help the ""lost lambs"" of the world. Her personality often leads her to be disgusted at the naivety of others, particularly Yui's, and she does not hesitate to show it. Despite this, Yui still affectionately calls her ""Yukinon.""


It was later revealed that her father is a member of the ""Diet"" or a legislator in Japan's parliament.

Onizuka, Eikichi;Eikichi Onizuka (鬼塚 英吉);Eikichi  Onizuka;"
Birthday: August 3, 1975

A 22-year-old, hormonal, blonde-haired biker and virgin, Onizuka Eikichi graduated from a bottom-rung university by cheating and, as such, cannot get a decent job. His main way of spending time is peering up girls' skirts in a local mall. He is very athletic, as he can bench press 150 kg (331 lbs), has a second dan black belt in karate, and even claims to perform 500 push-ups, 1000 pull ups and 2000 squats daily.

Through the events explained in the Great Teacher Onizuka manga, Onizuka decides to become a teacher, even though it is later implied that he has an IQ of about 50 (Though not necessarily true). His initial teacher training is in the Musashino Public High School, where he meets Nanako Mizuki. His experience taming the rowdy gangs in his assigned class hardens his convictions that teaching is the way to go, and when he learns of Mizuki's problems, he also decides to abstain from sexual experience with his students, opting to solve their personal issues for them, instead.

Unfortunately, he nearly messes up by forgetting to take the public teachers' civil service exam. As a result, no public high school will take him, but he is still eligible for a number of private schools. He manages to get a job at the upper-crust Holy Forest Academy, despite the objections of vice-principal Uchiyamada Hiroshi, whom he continues to aggravate well into his tenure. Of course, one of the conditions of having the job at Holy Forest is that he must sleep at the school—in the storage room at the top floor, with roof access—and it is here that Onizuka officially starts his career in teaching, when he stops Yoshikawa Noboru from committing suicide.

Onizuka is put in charge of class 3-4, a class so bad it has already driven several teachers insane. Not only does he survive the class's brutal bullying tactics, but he also befriends his students, and the backbone to the story of Great Teacher Onizuka consists of his unique experiences in turning his students around and learning lessons of his own.

It is later implied again, during the National Exams, that Onizuka might actually be some sort of genius. His exam results were swapped: once for full marks, and once for just short of full marks. However, when Yoshito Kikuchi is asked whether he is curious about Onizuka's true results, he checks the answers himself and the result amazes him. He checks with Onizuka, who states that he definitely got perfect results from his own effort (which would be incredible, since he did a 5 hour exam in 1 hour, bleeding, and having 4 bullets in his stomach).

Onizuka has incredible physical resilience. On more than one occasion, he has fallen from heights that would instantly kill most people and claims to have a sort of healing factor, as he healed from a broken arm in less than a day, and even endure multiple gunshot wounds, in a short period of time. Onizuka often presents his strength in unintentionally flamboyant ways, such as arm wrestling over 100 men of exponential strength in a row and winning (including the character Heihachi from the Tekken series of fighting games, and Jason Voorhees from the films called Friday the 13th (series)). His fighting abilities are not to be taken lightly either, as Onizuka is capable of fending off multiple opponents, even if they are well-armed, and almost never receives any physical damage.

In spite of his impressive fighting skills, Onizuka is often roughed up by his students, and others, whenever he behaves badly. It could be speculated that deep down, Onizuka knows when he's acting immature, and allows others to keep him in line. An example of this is when he forces his students to dig the earth for buried treasure during the Okinawa trip. Kanzaki Urumi kicks Onizuka into a hole, and later forces him to wear S&M garb and has him crawl around on all fours, with Urumi riding on his back. Yet another example is when Principal Uchiyamada has Onizuka over for dinner and hits him upside the head with a wooden bench after finding out that Onizuka was acting a bit of a letch with his daughter one day (Onizuka was playing ""where's the nipple"" with his daughter, at a karaoke bar in town).

His personal mode of transportation is a Kawasaki Z2 motorcycle 750cc type S. The bike itself is also featured heavily in the prequel series to GTO."
Kanzaki, Urumi;Urumi Kanzaki (神崎麗美);Urumi  Kanzaki;"
The antithesis to the ""dumb blonde"" stereotype, Urumi Kanzaki is a prodigy with an IQ over 200. She is also a heterochromatic, possessing different colored eyes: one brown and one blue. However, she is psychologically disturbed, having her fair share of hate toward teachers. Her genius is displayed repeatedly by such abstract actions as the detonation of time bombs (i.e. firecrackers in disposable boxes) and making a harmless snake look like a cobra using paper cutouts. Her intellect is also shown through actions, such as shouting curse words in French and being able to speak fluent Mandarin. On the trip in Okinawa, Toshito Kikuchi noted that she can speak 5 languages, but ironically, she doesn't understand what her Gundam otaku roommates say.


Her hatred for teachers stems from her time in elementary school. Urumi's teacher, Ms. Fujimori, while initially welcoming and receptive, wasn't able to handle her intellect properly, since she went to a second-rate college, and it was her first year teaching. Urumi's constant requests for the teacher's time, both inside and outside of school, as well as the fact that the lessons she wanted to learn from the teacher included extremely advanced, college-level subjects (such as differential calculus) eventually made the teacher snap. When Urumi interrupted Ms. Fujimori's lecture to correct her in front of the whole class, the teacher then told Urumi's secret to her class. While it isn't stated explicitly, it can be deduced that her intelligence is derived from her biological father, when Urumi tells Eikichi Onizuka that her mother had selected a sperm-donor, based on his intellect and nothing more. It is even suggested that her mother took the sperm from an American scientific genius (this information can be gleaned from a scene where Urumi and her mother visited some friends in the United States, and Urumi was led into a dark storage room by a doctor, who explains to her that her father is actually just a bottle of donated sperm); this also explains Urumi's natural, blond hair. Naturally, this caused a great deal of psychological trauma to Urumi, and quite an understandable hatred of teachers. It is still unclear what happened to Ms. Fujimori, as her last appearance in the storyline was begging Onizuka to help Urumi before something terrible happens to her. She is later found by Miyabi in a small apartment, and hired to torture Onizuka. Formerly a student at Holy Forest for a while, but stopped attending regularly after some time, she begins almost immediately, as she frames him for lechery and sends him to jail overnight, only to appear in class and on his homeroom roster the morning after. Onizuka's frustration with her vastly increases, when Vice-Principal Uchiyamada strictly advises him that he cannot inflict physical harm on her due, to her educational potential. Urumi is eventually able to turn Onizuka into her slave (more-or-less, her ""genie"") by threatening to have him arrested, after she fakes her death when he accidentally pushes her off a building. However, all this changes when she encounters her Ms. Fujimori again, awakening her deepest hatred and causing her to direct her wrath at the student body. Onizuka responds by bringing his biker gang to school and ""kidnaps"" her from class. He is finally able to get through to her by almost killing the two of them by jumping over - and nearly falling into - a gap at a suspension bridge, despite her attempts to convince him that she is not afraid of anything, including death. Onizuka makes her see past her trauma, however bad, just isn't worth messing up the present with (in the manga, he does this by having his biker friends share their life experiences with her). Inspired, she allies with Onizuka, and helps with his troubles. Despite her switch in allegiance, Urumi continues her feud with Miyabi, until Miyabi reveals her origins to the student body. Urumi retaliates by setting up a web page, where she promises to post pictures of Miyabi in her bathroom (Urumi had earlier placed a hidden camera), after a countdown timer reaches zero. However, the site reveals only a single photograph of Urumi, Miyabi, and Tomoko Nomura during their younger years. Urumi never had any intention of ruining Miyabi; she just wanted to scare her. Urumi attempts suicide at an indoor skiing arena by freezing to death, but Onizuka rescues her. It is after this incident that Urumi considers Onizuka to be her ""favorite."" She grows extremely infatuated with Onizuka, to the point of wanting to elope with Onizuka. Urumi takes a more stereotypical role of a character that prefers the use of violence, in response to jealousy - she is often seen beating Onizuka mercilessly every time he tries to fulfill his pervertednes. Urumi states Onizuka should wait for her hormones to start kicking in, because she's sure that she would have a bouncing body by then. Like Noboru Yoshikawa, her loyalty to Onizuka is extremely strong, to the point that she would consider suicide, if he were to leave, believing that her own life is worthless without him around.

Hiroshi is easily enraged by Onizuka's behavior basically always. He shows to have no respect for school delinquents or anyway rebels guys during the series. He believes that Onizuka is the evil root of all his misfortunes. He was visibly against Onizuka's hiring, but had to accept Principal Sakurai's positive decision.

Kikuchi, Yoshito;Yoshito Kikuchi (菊地 善人);"Yoshito ""Coochie"" Kikuchi";"
Yoshito Kikuchi is one of Eikichi Onizuka's students. This computer prodigy (scoring the highest without certain ""aid"" in the country, on a standardized test) serves as class president and is also notorious for making pornographic composite photos, during Onizuka's arrival at the Holy Forest Academy. He tries to blackmail him into resignation with several pictures posted all across the school for everyone to see. Onizuka catches Kikuchi and instead of punishing him, hires him to make composite pictures of Azusa Fuyutsuki and other female teachers, much to his surprise.

Kikuchi eventually befriends Onizuka, and later helps Noboru Yoshikawa prevent Anko Uehara's mother, the president of the local Parent-Teacher Association, from getting Onizuka fired. Kikuchi is an amateur martial artist, having prior experience in judo and other techniques learned from Mayu Wakui (in the live-action, he claims he only knows it, and does not demonstrate this claim). It is revealed after the examinations that he was the one who switched Onizuka's test papers for a perfect score. When questioned about the actual results that Onizuka has, Kikuchi calculates it himself, and is thoroughly surprised at the score (it is unknown whether Onizuka actually did score perfect, or a score befitting his intelligence), and asks him directly, to which his teacher replies that he definitely received a perfect score.

In the manga, a possible relationship is hinted between him and Ai Tokiwa, after some intervention and a forced embrace from Onizuka. In the live-action, Kikuchi has a long distance relationship with Tomoko Nomura.

A student at the Holy Forest Academy, and did not have a good time before Eikichi Onizuka arrived, being the victim of bullying, mostly from Uehara Anko and her group (Miyabi Aizawa replaces Anko's role in the live-action). He is extremely good with video games and is somewhat of an otaku, but proves to be quite handy with making things.

Anko's bullying is so bad it makes Noboru attempt to commit suicide twice, both times by leaping off the roof of the school, and both times resulting in him being saved by Onizuka, at the cost of Vice-Principal Hiroshi Uchiyamada's car. The two strike a quick friendship, which works for Onizuka, as Noboru has plenty of items that he wants to ""borrow"". His loyalty to Onizuka is by far the strongest, seen when he willingly sells his game collection to help cover Onizuka's debt.

While on the school trip to Okinawa, he gets room assigned with Anko and her friends by Onizuka. In retaliation for Onizuka and Noboru's antics, he gets tied up and led away into the dense jungle by the girls, but they all end up getting lost and rely on him for help. Despite the abuse, he saves Anko's life after she falls off a cliff, getting separated from the others. As the rest of the events of the manga unfolds, Noboru begins to enjoy Anko's company enough that she begins to feel affectionate to him."
Nomura, Tomoko;Tomoko Nomura (野村 朋子);"Tomoko ""Big Top, Toroko, Tomo"" Nomura";"
Birthday: September 25, 1985

A student in Eikichi Onizuka's class, Tomoko Nomura has a large chest (her cup size is F), but is not too bright, leading to people calling her Toro-ko (Toro meaning ""slow"" in Japanese; she is nicknamed Slo-mo-ko in the English version). After initially messing up her role in one of Miyabi Aizawa's plans to get Onizuka fired, she is cut off from Miyabi's group. Seeing her rather slow, clumsy nature, Onizuka enters her into a local beauty contest. He even arranges two porn producer friends to dress her up for the competition. Rather than read the given script for the acting category, Onizuka gives her a couple of action figures and she ends up doing an excellent improvised piece (with Vice-Principal Uchiyamada getting an accidental role). In the anime, Onizuka throws a cellphone on stage and she leaves a sentimental message on Miyabi's answering machine instead. She doesn't win, but she gets noticed by several television producers and begins starring in various commercials. Her young male manager, impressed with her natural beauty, and after falling in love at first sight, makes it his lifetime goal to help her succeed.

She was friends with Urumi Kanzaki since childhood, and their close bond likely arose out of their opposite personalities (Tomoko is clumsy and rather docile with a heart of gold, compared to Urumi's intellect and potential to be savagely cruel).

A side-story in the manga features Tomoko and her manager, also called GTO, only it stands for Great Tomoko Oppai (Oppai meaning breasts). In it, Tomoko's manager embarks on one very madcap adventure to save her from her dubious producers. In the live-action, instead of her succeeding dramatically in subsequent episodes, she would part for an Okinawa acting school."
Fuyutsuki, Azusa;Azusa Fuyutsuki (冬月 あずさ);Azusa  Fuyutsuki;"
A 22-year-old beautiful female teacher who is the heroine of the series. Unlike Onizuka, she led a relatively normal life, graduating from Waseda University. Her quiet manner and moderate ideas are misleading as she proves to be very tough on her own sometimes scaring even tough Onizuka. To prepare him for the test which would determine his teaching career, she prepares a mountain of jelly with eyes of Maguro tuna fish as fruits and imposes impossibly tough schedule that would have killed anyone or drove them mad. Her field of teaching is Kokugo or Japanese language (English in the Live Action). She, not that surprisingly, falls in love with Onizuka, but as both are quite reluctant to admit their feelings and show them in the open they claim that they are just ""friends"". It's not really a major matter to anyone else except Suguru Teshigawara, who finds it most aggravating that a woman with her qualifications would fall in love with one with such a crude background as Onizuka. She has difficulty with the female students in her class due to all the boys in her class having crushes on her but brings them around fairly quickly after Onizuka's advice. She has a younger sister named Makoto.

The Azusa Fuyutsuki portrayed in the live action drama differs greatly from the anime and manga versions. In that version, Fuyutsuki became a teacher because she felt she was forced to, and envies the life of her sister, who became a stewardess who frequently dates male celebrities (and receive some fancy gifts as well.) She eventually decides to remain a teacher thanks to some convincing from Onizuka, though the two are continuously depicted as at odds with each other with love strongly implied. The live-action version of Fuyutsuki also has a dislike for men in general, finding them too possessive over women, though Onizuka also convinces her that she too is guilty of that same sin. Interestingly, she is also present to many of the ""lessons"" that Onizuka personally teaches his students."
Murai, Kunio;Kunio Murai (村井 國男);Kunio  Murai;"
The class ""jock bully"", Kunio Murai is not very bright and loses his temper easily. When Eikichi Onizuka arrives at the Holy Forest Academy, Kunio and his gang (consisting of Kouji Fujiyoshi and Tadaaki Kusano) attempt to kill him several times with seemingly innocent pranks, such as a cockroach planted in his school lunch. The plans backfire (such as Kunio eating the cockroach, instead) and he goes insane, nearly ending up with his face impaled on a pair of razor-sharp scissors. Onizuka then takes advantage of Kunio's 27 year-old mother, Julia Murai, after trouncing Kunio at several arcade games. It is later revealed that Julia was carrying her son at the age of 13, and her parents and boyfriend abandoned her, making Kunio overprotective of his mother.

Kunio and his gang befriend Onizuka, after he saves them from a group of ruffians, but not before Onizuka joins the ruffians and has Kunio bungee jump off the Tokyo Bay Bridge. Kunio still gets very angry when Onizuka tries to make a pass at his mother, especially with the possibility that Onizuka may well be his new stepfather. His fear of a new father also rears its head when he suspects his mother may be marrying a man who resembles Dr. Elefun from Astro Boy.

Aizawa, Miyabi;Miyabi Aizawa (相沢雅);Miyabi  Aizawa;"
In the anime, Aizawa began not to trust teachers anymore when one of her classmates got involved in a scandal due to an affair of their former instructor. From this, she and her cohorts began their quest of kicking out any teacher who will be assigned to their class. They were successful in making these teachers resign, but Onizuka...


In the manga, what drives Miyabi to go bad and lead a rebellion against teachers is an incident which occurred when she was in the 7th grade. She had been the favorite student of Mr. Ogi, teacher of Class 2-4 (the name of her class back in junior high). Ogi would praise her for her beauty and intelligence often. Miyabi misinterpreted this as Mr. Ogi having a crush on her. As a result, Miyabi began behaving and dressing in a more mature manner. She started cooking him lunch every day. She also started wearing revealing clothes ( such as miniskirts and tanktops). Instead of setting Miyabi straight, Mr. Ogi went along with it. To some degree, he did like Miyabi. He continued to praise her and accept her subtle advances. One day, Miyabi is invited to Mr. Ogi's house. She goes, thinking he is going to confess his love for her. As soon as she gets there, Mr. Ogi introduces her to his fiance. Miyabi storms off in tears, feeling hurt and used. As revenge, Miyabi takes illicit photos of herself and goes into class the next morning telling her classmates that Mr. Ogi raped her and then took pictures (knowing that Mr. Ogi's hobby is photography). Since that day, Miyabi has hated teachers."

Koiwai, Yotsuba;Yotsuba Koiwai (小岩井 四葉);Yotsuba  Koiwai;"
Yotsuba is drawn as a small girl with green hair done in four pigtails, giving her somewhat the appearance of her namesake, a four-leaf clover. She has a carefree and energetic personality, taking delight in simple matters even as she learns about all manner of things in her daily life. In Japanese, Yotsuba's dialogue is written without kanji, making it seem simpler and more child-like, and in a typeface that gives the impression of speaking with high intensity. Her energy is noted by other characters, especially members of the neighboring Ayase family. Her father says of her carefree nature, ""She can find happiness in anything. Nothing in this world can get her down."" However, when deeply frightened or upset, she does cry, and she has an unexplained fear of anything resembling a bullseye.

At the start of the series, Yotsuba is shown as having very little knowledge of the world around her, even for a young child. Things such as swings, doorbells, cicadas, and air conditioners all fascinate and confuse her, although she is not perturbed by her ignorance. She occasionally mispronounces new words and creates neologisms, such as ""Yotsubox"" as a portmanteau of ""Yotsuba's Box"", and often repeats, in incongruous ways, phrases spoken by adult characters around her. Yotsuba is frequently shown drawing, though she is not as good an artist as she thinks she is, and she is an excellent swimmer.

The series provides few details about her life before its start. She is an adopted child, with her birthplace unknown to the reader, although she claims she's from an island ""to the left."" Koiwai, Yotsuba's adopted father, says he met her as an orphan in a foreign country and before he knew it he was raising her as his own; she is sometimes taken for a foreigner by strangers. When asked about her mother, she doesn't understand the question, and she gets confused by the concept of having two sets of grandparents. Before moving to her current home, Yotsuba lived in the country with Koiwai and his mother. She initially claims to Fuka Ayase she is six years old, but her father later corrects this, saying she is in fact five years old.

Yotsuba has never attended school, and as of the first chapter does not know what a grade is. In chapter 35, she fails to understand repeated explanations of homework."
Ayase, Fuuka;Fuuka Ayase (綾瀬 風香);Fuuka  Ayase;"
The middle Ayase sister, Fuka (also romanized as Fuuka) is 16 years old and in her second year at a local high school. She is the most responsible of the sisters, and during Yotsuba's first visit to her school, one student calls her ""vice-president."" She finds herself frequently helping the Koiwais, even though she does not intend to and is more flustered by their eccentricities than anyone else. Fuuka is often teased by the other characters, especially about her fashion sense and sense of humor. She is fond of making bad puns, which irritates Asagi, and wearing shirts with odd or interesting graphics (such as Chiyo's ""father"" from Azumanga Daioh, who also appears as a plushie in her room).

(Source: Wikipedia)"
Koiwai, Yousuke;Yousuke Koiwai (小岩井 葉介);"Yousuke ""Daddy"" Koiwai";"
Yotsuba's adoptive father. The circumstances of her adoption are obscure—he tells Fuuka that without intending to, he found himself taking care of her while somewhere overseas, but gives no other details. Though he acknowledges Yotsuba is a bit odd, he can be offbeat himself. He is depicted as something of a slacker; he habitually wears an undershirt and boxer shorts when working at home during the summer, and apologizes more than once for being ""irresponsible."" He works from home as a translator, though what languages and materials he translates is unknown. Regardless of his skills as a parent, Koiwai tries to be a good father to Yotsuba.

(Source: Wikipedia)"
Takeda, Takashi;"Takashi Takeda (竹田 隆; ジャンボ)";"Takashi ""Jumbo"" Takeda";"
A friend of Koiwai and Yotsuba, having known Koiwai since they were childhood classmates. Standing 210 centimeters (6 ft 11 in) tall, he dwarfs the other characters, especially Yotsuba. He is always called by the nickname ""Jumbo,"" and when Fuka learns his real name she calls it ""common."" He works at his father's flower shop, as Yotsuba discovers when she meets him there. He helps the Koiwais move in and frequently visits their house, where he is more or less treated as a member of the family by Yotsuba.

Jumbo has a dry sense of humor and is prone to deadpan quips, which sometimes confuse members of the Ayase family. At the same time, he is impulsive, and sometimes spontaneously organizes activities for the younger children, such as fishing and star-gazing. As he does this, he enters a bizarre one-sided rivalry with Miura, including spending a single day in Hawai'i after he learns that she will be going abroad. He develops a deep infatuation with Asagi when he first meets her, but is too nervous around women to directly act on it. Instead, he tries to use Yotsuba's friendship with Asagi as a way of getting close to her, though his plans usually backfire.

Ayase, Asagi;Asagi Ayase (綾瀬 あさぎ);Asagi  Ayase;"
The eldest of the three Ayase sisters, Asagi lives at home while attending a nearby university. She is depicted as an attractive young woman who enjoys teasing people, especially her parents; her friend Torako describes her as a horrible person for teasing Ena. She is the best of her family at managing Yotsuba, and her mother claims she was much like Yotsuba when she was young. Asagi's irreverence may have come from her mother's teasing when she was a child—for example, when Asagi found a four-leaf clover, Mrs. Ayase asked for a five-leaf clover instead, which Asagi could not find.

Ayase, Ena;Ena Ayase (綾瀬 恵那);Ena  Ayase;"
The youngest Ayase sister, Ena is a few years older than Yotsuba and her most frequent playmate. She is sensible for her age and tries to be responsible by recycling and limiting her use of air conditioning. Her attempts to spare Yotsuba's feelings sometimes lead her to make little white lies, such as praising Yotsuba's childish sketches or letting her believe that Miura's cardboard costume is a real robot named Cardbo (in ADV's translation) or Danbo (in Yen's translation) (ダンボー, Danbō?), with consequences that rebound on herself and Miura. Ena likes drawing, something at which she is quite skilled, and playing with her teddy bears, either by herself or with Yotsuba. Ena is unsqueamish and even enthusiastic about such things as handling large frogs and gutting live fish.

Yasuda;"Yasuda  (ヤンダ; 安田)";"Yasuda ""Yanda"" ";"
Yanda, given name Yasuda, is a friend of Koiwai and Jumbo. Though mentioned in the first and fourth chapters, when Jumbo calls Yanda ""no good"" for making lame excuses for not helping the Koiwais move, he does not appear until chapter 30. He is somewhat childish, as shown by the tit-for-tat pranks he plays on Yotsuba, including bribing her with candy then taking it back when it does not work, eating her ice cream, and prank-calling her, and is shown enjoying teasing Yotsuba and acting as her ""nemesis"". Koiwai refers to Yanda as his kōhai, but in what context he is Koiwai's junior is unknown. He is living from paycheck to paycheck, telling Koiwai that he eats instant ramen because he does not get paid until the end of the month, and only eating frozen meals the rest of the time.

Torako;Torako  (虎子);"Torako ""Tora"" ";"
A friend of Asagi's, surname unknown, who attends the same university. She smokes constantly and appears obsessed with being cool. Because of this, she sometimes gets annoyed with Yotsuba's antics, though she also admits to Koiwai she's not used to being around small children. Her name means ""tiger"" (虎, tora?) ""girl"" (子, ko?) and Yotsuba frequently calls her just Tora (""tiger""). She is the only member of the younger cast with a car.

Hiwatari;Hiwatari  (日渡);"Hiwatari ""Shimauu, Miss Stake"" ";"
A friend of Fuka's, given name unknown, who is in the same homeroom. Her first official appearance is in chapter 45, when she visits Fuka's home and recognizes Yotsuba from her trip to their high school in chapter 40. Hiwatari has a somewhat eccentric personality. She is normally called by her nickname Miss Stake (しまうー, Shimaū?) due to a ""mistake"" she made when she first introduced herself to her class (in Japanese, shimau used as an auxiliary verb can mean to do something by accident, hence the pun).

Holo;Holo  (ホロ);"Holo ""Wisewolf of Yoitsu, Wheaten Tail, Holoh of the Wheat Tail, Sage Wolf of Yoitsu, Horo"" ";"
Age: Unknown
Height: 160 cm
Weight: 43 kg

Holo is a wolf harvest deity originally from a land in the north known as Yoitsu. She made a promise with men from a town called Pasloe where she would ensure the town would have good wheat harvests year after year. However, as time went on, the townspeople slowly started to forsake Holo and did not rely on her as they once did. As such, Holo escapes from town in Lawrence's wagon and started traveling with him to see how much the world has changed since she has been in Pasloe. Holo has chosen the form of a girl younger than Lawrence, though she still retains her large white-tipped wolf tail, and ears. Her true form is that of a very large wolf which many people revered and feared.

She refers to herself as the ""Wise Wolf of Yoitsu"" (ヨイツの賢狼). She is typically very haughty and self-sufficient, though due to her isolation for hundreds of years in Pasloe, she gradually feels very lonely, and sometimes shows a more fragile side of herself. She relies on Lawrence for company as she fears loneliness, which is something that Lawrence is very aware of and tries to comfort her in his own way. Holo is also very aware of the different time spans that she and Lawrence have, as a human lifespan is like a blink of an eye for her kind. Holo is quite scared of that fact, but hides it with jokes. She has a peculiar way of speaking, modeled after that of the oiran high-class courtesans. She is fond of delicious food and alcohol, but especially loves apples. She takes pride in her tail and takes special care of it, constantly combing and maintaining it.

Note: Concerning the spelling of Holo's name, Yen Press has stated that they ""were instructed that the proper spelling of the character's name is indeed Holo"" by the Japanese licensor."

Kraft Lawrence, who chiefly goes by his surname, is a twenty-five-year-old traveling peddler who goes from town to town buying and selling various things in order to make a living. When he was twelve, he became an apprentice to a merchant relative, and set out on his own at eighteen. His goal in life is to gather enough money to start his own shop, and he has already been traveling for seven years while gaining experience in the trade. He meets Holo one night and eventually agrees to her traveling with him. She helps him by providing her wisdom which helps to increase his profits and get him out of jams.

Full name: Fleur von Eiterzental Bolan; Fleur von Eiterzental Mariel Bolana.
Also: that fox, that vixen in Holo's words.

Eve is a traveling merchant stationed in the port town of Lenos by the time Lawrence meets her. She's originally from the Kingdom Of Winfield, however, due to events in her past, she was forced to leave and start a new life as a merchant. As a merchant, she's extremely skilled and keen-eyed towards either profit or people. Hard to approach, few actually know that she's a woman. This is due to the fact that, for convenience, she wears heavy layers of cloth (usual to northern merchants) but also a long scarf that covers almost her entire face. When she's not wearing this outfit, she's known for extreme beauty and perfectly portrait a naive town lass.


She is in fact a fallen noble that was once sold as slave to another merchant after her family's fall. After going through horrible times, now she aims only profit, no matter the means necessary for it. In Lenos, she betrays Lawrence in their fur deal and flees to Kerube.

In the novels (volumes 8 and 9):

After getting caught in the Narwal mess in Kerube, her plan fails and she's nearly killed by Kieman. Lawrence saves her and later on she gives him more information on the wolf bones they're searching, along with her ""true"" noble name ...and a kiss. Holo obviously snaps at it. She aims to be the ""prince merchant,"" a position atop all other merchants and trade companies, who directly negotiates with the nobility, can set deals between nations, and reports only to the king himself. Metaphorically, she is trying to live her life by herself. As a consequence from her past, she feels the need to set her own limits.

As the princess and the only heir of the Kouka Kingdom, Yona was raised with extreme care and gets whatever she wants, for example, beautiful accessories and clothing. This lead her to being a spoiled princess. After some life-changing events, Yona developed into a strong young lady who lives for the people of Kouka Kingdom, while also paying back the friends who helped her survive.


During her early childhood until her 16th birthday, Yona had a huge crush on her cousin, Soo-Won. This later changes after Soo-Won murders her father. Their relation afterwards can be seen as very awkward.

Eventually, Yona develops romantic feelings for Hak, although she never admits it to him in fear that he might tease her."

He is the blue dragon and has dragon eyes that allows him to see great distances. Shin-Ah's dragon eyes are also capable of disrupting the nerves of anyone he glares at until it kills them.


Later in the story, his power was explained in more detail. His victims are subject to fatal hallucinations. In extreme cases he can cause their entire bodies to stop functioning, including their hearts. However, he does not have full control over this power and will lose himself to the blue dragon's murderous willpower. When he finishes using that ability, he himself becomes paralyzed as a result, making the power a double-edged sword. He almost lost complete control when Yona was captured by some bandits (they were in the fire tribe and Shinah was assigned to protect Yona), causing them to have hallucinations after his mask was knocked off by a bandit. However, she wasn’t afraid of his power and saved him from losing to his power (though it wasn’t easy because he lost himself and didn’t recognise her). He was scared that he wouldn’t be able to stay by Yona’s side anymore and she would hate him because of this. But she reassured his importance to her and to continue to stay with the group.

He joins the group immediately after the Awa arc. Later on it's revealed that he was watching Yona ever since she was chased out of Hiryuu castle to see if she was fit to use the power of the four dragons. After the events in Awa he decided that he wanted to follow her, so he showed up at the campfire. In chapter 100, it is revealed that he is immortal, and that he is the original dragon warrior who received the blood of the Yellow Dragon in the era of king Hiryuu (and thus is more than 2000 years old). His power worked by having certain areas of his body being seriously injured before having that part regenerating back quickly. This was why he appeared to be a normal human when Hak tried to test whether his body was indestructible (he was not seriously injured). While his body is regenerating, scales appear on the places where his wounds were, making his body as hard as steel. According to Zeno himself, during regeneration his physical power is no less than Kija's dragon arm or Jae-Ha's dragon leg. His personality is very childish, but he sometimes displays a strange insight and wisdom only someone older could possess. He was married in the past to a sickly girl named Kaya.

He started to ignore those around him (imagining them with a large X across their face) and was driven to the point of suicide. He changed his mind after he apologized to Nishimiya and began to spend time with her. He learned sign language specifically so he could apologize to her and is shown to be very talented in it. He feels like he hasn't been punished enough for bullying Nishimiya and often wishes he could kill his younger self. He seems resigned to the fact that he will never be able to have friends again."

Yuzuru is extremely protective of her big sister and has a deep hatred of all the people who ever bullied her, in particular Ishida; however, upon learning that Ishida has changed, she mellows down, accepts, and even encourages him to go out with her sister, though she is frustrated of their reluctance to do anything about their feelings and never moving past their relationship as friends. Yuzuru often bunks off school to take photos of dead animals and insects, which causes her and her mother to not get along.


It is later revealed that she only took these photos so that when her sister saw them she would see how horrible death is and not try to kill herself.

After having separated from him since middle school graduation, Ueno runs into Ishida years later, herself now working in a cat café.


It is revealed that Ueno is in love with Ishida and originally picked on Nishimiya to impress him, however when she learned that Nishimiya was cleaning the offensive words off Ishida's desk before he could see them she convinced herself that Nishimiya also loved Ishida and was using her disability to get his attention, leading her to grow jealous and resentful toward Nishimiya. However, unlike Ishida, Ueno never learns her lesson and continues to hate and bully Nishimiya once she reconnects with her through Kawai and Sahara (whom she remained friends with). Ueno watched Ishida suffer through middle school—still being bullied for what he did to Nishimiya—and feels bad herself for being unable to do anything. She claims that their sadness, from her having to cut off contact with Ishida to him hating everyone, including her, has all been because of Nishimiya. In truth, however, Ueno is irritated because Nishimiya never defends herself whenever she is bullied, thinking her as a weak person because of this. Despite being within the group of friends, Ishida still imagines Ueno with an X over her face, showing his disgust with her, until after his release from hospital, after which Ueno is dragged by Sahara to become her assistant as a model.

He is shown to be quite obsessive and protective of Ishida and often dislikes him befriending other people. However, Nagatsuka is also supportive of Ishida and often offers advice. He has plans to become a millionaire, so is willing to hand out money to friends and is keen to become a film director—entering himself and Ishida into a film competition. It is shown both Ueno and Kawai find Nagatsuka repulsive, while Ishida is uncomfortable that Nagatsuka is so willing to take his side when he knows so little about him. Though his film proves to be a failure, this only made Nagatsuka resolved to take up film studies as his college subject.

A kind girl from Ishida and Nishimiya's elementary school. She was the only person willing to make an effort to learn sign language and befriend Nishimiya.


Sadly, this singled her out for bullying too and started to take all her classes in the nurse's office. Ishida finds Sahara several years later so she can reconnect with Nishimiya, and she becomes her friend again. She was always and is still bullied by Ueno for her unorthodox sense of fashion, however the two remain close even after they separated and Sahara boldly claims they are now best friends. Sahara has grown very tall during the time-skip and due to her high heel boots appears even taller. After Ishida, Sahara spends the most time with the Nishimiya family; however, their relationship is briefly strained when Ishida decides to cut off all ties with his friends by insulting them, claiming that Sahara is always the first to run away from a problem. Sahara later texts Ishida asking how he could prove that he has grown up; this motivates him to risk his life saving Nishimiya during her attempted suicide. Fed up of Ueno always blaming Nishimiya for everything, she chooses to take Nishimiya's side and defends her from being attacked by Ueno during Ishida's hospitalization. After graduating from high school, Sahara goes to Tokyo to become a runway model, bringing an unwilling Ueno with her.

Mashiba was lonely as a child and the other children took him for granted and bullied him, now he is completely intolerant of bullies in any form, and while generally calm and level-headed, he reacts violently to any random act of bullying he sees.


He is oblivious to Kawai's crush on him until Ishida points it out. It is later revealed that Mashiba befriends Ishida because of his social awkwardness and never being able to fit in at school despite trying to; by hanging out with Ishida—believing him to be even stranger than he is—he would appear normal. However, this only makes him feel that he should be the least important amongst the group. Thus, when Ishida asks Mashiba to hit him after the former reveals his bullying records, he calmly does so. Mashiba is the first to reconcile with Ishida upon his release from hospital and later studies to become a teacher after graduation.

Ginko;Ginko  (ギンコ);"Ginko ""Mushishi, Yoki"" ";"
Ginko employs himself as a Mushi master (mushishi), traveling from place to place to research Mushi and aid people suffering from problems caused by them.

Ginko is a rare person who attracts mushi. This inspires his peripatetic lifestyle; staying in one place too long will gather a potentially dangerous amount of mushi. He also smokes constantly in order to keep mushi away.

In terms of personality, Ginko is rather laid back, but can be very serious when it comes to protecting people from mushi. He also often stresses that the mushi are not evil, but they merely exist as a part of the nature and try to survive like every other living being.


When Nui found him, he was unconscious in the woods, wounded and abandoned. As he had no place to go, Nui decided to care for him instead of making him leave. He went by the name ""Yoki"" until Nui was consumed by the Ginko mushi. Yoki lost his memory and was forced to take a new name because of the nature of the Ginko mushi, thus changing his name in the only thing he remembers, ""Ginko""

Ginko's unusual white hair and green eye color is the result of an incident involving a mushi that occurred when he was a child.

He lost his other eye and hair color when he tried to save Nui from the Ginko mushi that lived in the pond near where they lived. Nui protected Ginko by telling him to offer them as a sacrifice so the Ginko would let him be. He never saw Nui again and after nearly being consumed by the mushi he adopted the name Ginko to save himself."
Karibusa, Tanyuu;Tanyuu Karibusa (狩房 淡幽);Tanyuu  Karibusa;"
Long ago, there was a mushi unlike any other, a forbidden mushi that destroyed all things indiscriminately. But a mushishi of the Karibusa family sealed this forbidden mushi inside herself, turning her skin the color of ink and eventually killing her. But not before she had a child.

Since then, one in every other generation of the Karibusa family has carried the forbidden mushi inside them, rendering part of their bodies ink black and useless. But they have learned how to bind it. By listening to stories of the death of other mushi, they can subdue the forbidden mushi and use its mark like ink to write these stories down and seal the forbidden mushi away on paper. Those who do this are the Recorders. They live in an isolated house with their records, visited only by the family and mushishi.

Karibusa Tanyuu is the fourth Recorder. The curse is located on her right leg, and she has learned to be skillful at moving on crutches and hopping on one foot. And in spite of the pain that this forbidden mushi constantly causes her, she loves and respects mushi, all forms of life. She is proud but kind, and there is no one who could do her job more effectively.

Tanyuu's deepest desire is to complete the sealing away of the forbidden mushi, and to be freed to travel with Ginko.

Affiliation: Hero Association
Partner(s): Genos

Saitama is the most powerful hero alive. Having apparently trained himself to superhuman condition, Saitama faces an existential crisis as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from his heroic deeds.

He is registered with the Heroes Association as a C-Class Superhero and is tasked to defend Z-City against Mysterious Beings.

Saitama is usually deliberately drawn in a simpler style than other characters, with a very rounded head and only a simple mouth and eyes. When drawn in a more 'action-oriented' style with more detail, Saitama is revealed to have sharp features, dangerous looking eyes, and chiseled musculature. His costume is a plain yellow jumpsuit with a short zipper at the collar and a belt. The costume is finished out by an ensemble of red boots and gloves, and a white cape.

For a superhero, Saitama is rather laid back. Because even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, he doesn't take his hero work very seriously. In spite of this, he is constantly searching for an opponent that can challenge him, since his superhero work is beginning to bore him because it's too easy. The combination of his attitude, unstoppable strength, and distinctively simple and 'unimpressive' appearance often cause his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms before suddenly and nonchalantly obliterating them with one punch.

Ogami, Ittou;Ittou Ogami (拝 一刀);"Ittou ""Lone Wolf"" Ogami";"
Ogami Itto seemed to have a very cushy life during Edo-Era Japan, for he had been the Shogun's official executioner (Kogi Kaishakunin). A position so powerful, the term ""Second"" meant that Itto was only second to the Shogun as far as metering out death to unloyal feudal lords throughout the 60 regions of Shogunate controlled Japan. In fact, the Shogun's symbol of the Hollyhock crest was a noticeable part of Ogami's court attire, thus deeming his stature as indeed being the Shogun's final say over his people. The Kogi Kaishakunin was highest of the three positions given to certain clans of samurai under the Shogun to root out corruption amongst the feudal lords who answered to his Highness about the land. The second clan was the Yagyu who assassinated anyone caught doing treasonous deeds. The third clan was the Kurokawa. Shinobi (ninja) sent to spy on daimyos (lords) and report back to the Shogunate.

Ogami won his exulted position, by protecting his Highness during the contest to choose the Executioner. The opponent, Gunbei Yagyu, disarmed Itto but blatantly pointed the tip of his sword at the Shogun in his victory over Itto. Ogami seeing this as a direct threat to his Highness stepped in between the sword and the Shogun and thus won the slot of Kogi Kaishakunin. This did not bode well with the ancient patriarch of the Yagyu, Lord Retsudo. Angered that his son lost on a technicality, he plotted against Itto and eventually set off the events that would transform the Shogun's executioner into the assassin known as Kozure Okami (Lone Wolf and Cub).

Returning home from work one evening, Itto finds his pregant wife Azami more fragile than she should be. It seems Lady Ogami has been suffering from terrible nightmares as of late, that the men Itto put to death were cursing the Ogami line. Ogami comforts his wife by explaining if the child they were expecting was a boy, why he chose the name Daigoro. Sadly, Azami's premonition comes true as she is murdered the next day. To further destroy Itto politically and literally, a death tablet bearing the emblem of the Hollyhock crest is placed in the shine he built to pray for the people he was required to execute.

And this is where things fall apart, finding his wife dead (and Daigoro cut out of his mother's womb), Itto is devastated. The next morning, the chief inspector of the region (a Yagyu named Bizen), reveals to Itto that he is being tried for treason again his Highness, because of the blasphemous memorial tablet rumored to be in the Ogami memorial shrine. Itto-completely perplexed by such an accusation-agrees to let Bizen investigate the rumor, only to find that there is such a tablet in the shrine!

While Bizen expects Itto to accept his fate of seppuku and slay both himself and his newborn son, Ogami soon smells a rat and realizes that the Ura Yagyu (the shadow Yagyu clan led by Retsudo) are behind this plot to undo him. After he refuses to kill himself and his son, Itto proceeds to cut through the Yagyu guards sent to ensure that Ogami follows the order through. Instead, a deal is made between Retsudo and Itto; a quick battle to decide if Itto will live outside of the region of Edo, or die right then and there, Ogami swears vengeance on the Yagyu clan and thus takes his son into Meifumado (Hell). Becoming an assassin and leaving his official samurai life behind, Itto can strike back at his most hated foes and eventually bring down the clan who murdered his wife and ruined his House.

For 500 gold pieces and the condition that every aspect of why the employer wants the assassination done, Itto now known as Kozure Okami, sets about bringing his own brand of justice to the realm, all the while teaching Daigoro what it means to be samurai. And what a journey it is. Pushing his son around Japan in a souped up wooden, metal and bamboo baby cart, it's a strange and loving testament between father and son.

There is little autobiographical data on Itto save for the following: He claimed he was from the Sakushu region of Japan, has served the Shogun for 27 years, and is a master of ""suemono giri"" (cutting through stationery objects). Another note: his name might not really be a name but the title ""sacred sword"" which almost sounds like a translation of his name.

Not long after birth he found himself in many orphanages and facilities. However, he quickly grew tired of the boring life and frequently escaped, eventually finding his way to the Doya Town the story takes place in.

Joe is rude and quick to fight, but he can also be very frivolous at times. Because of his rough upbringing he is a delinquent who likes his solitude, but he later grows to appreciate his new friends and rivals. He is not very good at understanding women, and essentially only treats them nice out of obligation.

Danpei is Joe's serious, cautious and responsible mentor who gets him started in his boxing career. He is fond of sake, being overly cheerful when drunk which contrasts with his strict everyday self. He is also very polite when talking to people that hold higher ranks than himself, something that annoys Joe, who doesn't care for such things.

Prior to meeting Joe, it is stated that Danpei used to be a boxer himself.
However, after the loss of one of his eyes, we learn that he was forced to give up on his own boxing career, aiming to become a coach instead. But due to his violent, strict, passionate and even desperate approach in training his boxers (who couldn't take it and abandoned him for better gyms) he became jobless and eventually a homeless alcoholic.

After meeting Joe and claiming that he has massive potential for the sport, he gives up on drinking due to the former's aversion to alcoholism (only drinking on special occasions) and vows to train him to be Japan's or even the world's best boxer, with the hope of a better tomorrow for the both of them."

Yoko Shiraki is a young woman born to the Shirakis, a very wealthy family who is known for their activities in the boxing field.She is the main female protagonist in Ashita no Joe.

She is very polite, graceful and kind to other people, always acting exactly as expected from a daughter born to a family with a higher rank, donating to charities from time to time.As so, she clashes in both appearance and personality with most of the other characters who know nothing but poverty and hardship.

One of those characters is Joe who is the first to remark that her so called 'kindness' is completely fake, implying her sympathy for the poor is merely a way to make herself feel superior over those who have nothing to eat.She is often very shocked by his actions but as time goes on she comes to be the one who understands him best.

She is disliked by Joe as an 'evil woman' who tries to control his life by always having something to do with most the situations he finds himself in later in the series.


After gradually coming to like him(and showing very subtle and growing hints throughout the series, she confesses her love for Joe in the lockeroom right before the world title fight, begging him not to fight José Mendoza for her sake."

Natsume, Takashi;Takashi Natsume (夏目貴志);Takashi  Natsume;"
Age: 15-16
Birthday: July 1 (Cancer)
Height: 167 cm
Blood Type: B

Natsume Takashi is the main protagonist of the series who, like his deceased grandmother Natsume Reiko, has the ability to see ayakashi (spirits). He inherited the Book of Friends from her, a book of contracts binding ayakashi to servitude when they were defeated by Reiko. Due to Natsume's strong resemblance to his grandmother, he is often mistaken for her and is pursued by ayakashi who hate Reiko but yearn for the Book of Friends. To rid himself of these troubles, Natsume resolved to end the book by returning all the contracted names to their former owners. He is accompanied by the youkai Madara, nicknamed ""Nyanko-sensei"" (or simply ""sensei""), promising him possession of the book once he dies. In return, the creature must serve as his bodyguard until then.

Orphaned at an early age, Natsume was passed on from relative to relative. His ability to see and communicate with ayakashi isolated him from both family and friends throughout his childhood. He was labeled as a 'liar' and 'attention seeker' for trying to tell others about the ayakashi, and his attempts to run away from the youkai had them calling him insane. Natsume then became reclusive in order to try to lead a relatively “normal” life with people. Eventually, he was passed on to the Fujiwaras, a middle-aged couple from his father's side of the family. In contrast to the relatives before, they genuinely care for Natsume, and he loves them in return. He does not want to cause them any trouble, so the ayakashi problem remains secret.

Natsume's incredibly strong spiritual power allows him to actually hit and hurt youkai. He develops friendships with youkai and exorcists alike, though the interest of many is to use him to their advantage. In the anime, Natsume is more cheery and good-natured, while in the manga, he is slightly more dismal and short-tempered, especially toward Nyanko-sensei.

To return the names inscribed in the Book of Friends, Natsume must first picture the said ayakashi in his mind to learn of its name. The book then flips open to the page where the name is written, which he takes out and places in his mouth while breathing out. The spell which originally enslaved the spirits used Reiko's saliva and breath; as Reiko's grandson and one who bears a strong resemblance to Reiko, Natsume is able to use the spell as well. The cost of releasing each name, however, is that his energy is almost completely drained in the process."
Madara;Madara  (斑);"Madara ""Sensei, Nyanko, Nyangoro, Nyankichi, Ponta, Nyanta, Nyan-Nyan"" ";"
Madara was sealed in a shrine until he was accidentally released by Natsume. Because Madara was trapped in a material form for so long, Madara ordinary takes on the shape of a maneki neko (lucky cat), leading Natsume to nickname him Nyanko-sensei. In this form, other people can see him, leading for Natsume having to ask his guardians if he could keep him as a pet.

Madara is a powerful spirit, who protects Natsume from others and teaches him spells on occasion, in return for Natsume's promise to give him the Book of Friends when he dies. They often fight each other, which leads to Natsume punching Madara on the face and knocking him out. Despite his protests of not being a cat, he likes to play with cat toys. Nyanko's design is based on a lucky cat statue Midorikawa was given as a child. In the anime, Natsume is more respectful to Madara."
Natsume, Reiko;Reiko Natsume (夏目 レイコ);Reiko  Natsume;"
Takashi Natsume's grandmother, from whom he inherited the ability to see yokai. Reiko had high spiritual energy, which gave her the ability to see and seal yokai.

Reiko was always shunned and even got rocks thrown at her for being able to see yokai. That is why she created the Book of Friends, Reiko was lonely and wanted friends. Since she believed no human could ever understand her, she turned to the spirits for companionship. Reiko was extraordinarily powerful, and so she bullied spirits into obeying her by playing games with them. If they lost, she would make them give her their names. Reiko gathered the names into the Book of Friends, this gave her the ability to summon whichever yokai she had the name of. A necessary part of the sealing was her saliva and breath. Madara mentions that she had sloppy table manners and was very forgetful.

Reiko died when she was young, so no one remembered her."

Cold hearted and rational. He uses ayakashi as bait to exorcise other ones and wants stronger ones to protect humans (although he doesn't mind hurting humans too when they're in his way). Ayakashis are just replaceable tools for him. He mainly uses a bow and arrow against them and if he finds their sealing troublesome, he prefers eliminating them. In the past one of the Matoba clan offered his right eye to an ayakashi for assistance, but in the end he never gave it. Ever since than the heads of the clan has had their right eye targetted by that ayakashi. Matoba Seiji still has his eye, but (according to his words) has a horrible scar."

Tohru Taki is a female student at Natsume's school. She was first ""discovered"" by one of Natsume's friends, Nishimura who had heard rumors of her beauty and became entranced, he still maintains an obvious crush on her even though Natsume holds most of her attention.

Taki is introduced into the story as a shy, silent girl. Later, the reason for this is because she was cursed by a yokai; the last 13 names said by her will be eaten by him at the end of a one year period. The yokai also throws her into an impossible gamble for her life which he does not honor even when she wins.

Taki is generally a happy, extroverted and optimistic girl. She is shown to have a peculiar taste in cuteness, as is shown when she hugs Nyanko-sensei, calling him cute. Like Tanuma, she tries to help Natsume in any way she can, but is usually prevented from doing so because Natsume worries about their involvement with yokai.

Even though Taki herself has too little spirit energy to see yokai, she does have the knowledge of drawing yokai circles, discovered by her grandfather. The circle, once drawn, gives any human the ability to see yokai who step within the radius of the circle. The circle does not require any spirit energy to create and activate, so anyone could possible draw it if they know how to. But due to it being complicated in looks, Taki is presummably the only one able to draw it without the need of a guide."

The Youkai is always seen by herself, and shows dislike to humans, often calling them rude, selfish and complicated beings. She is always seen attempting to scare people who walk pass the tree, but none can see her, in result. She gets mad occasionally if someone does any harm to the tree, she would do her best to chase them off. She is also able to transform in to a black and white cat, which humans can see."

When she was in the first year of high school, she encountered a mysterious crab, after which she became nearly weightless. Ever since then, she has avoided contact with everyone else, threatening everyone who discovers her secret. She called herself a tsundere and always speaks in an abusive style.


At the end of Mayoi Snail, she admits that she loves Koyomi, and subsequently enters into a relationship with him. After the events in Tsukihi Phoenix, she overcomes all of her trauma, and becomes a rather cheerful and normal girl. She starts calling Araragi with a cute nickname, chuckling at small things and sending e-mails full of emoticons, although her sharp tongue is still there, but toned down. She also seems to have a father complex as she becomes excited to the point of being unable to fall asleep when using her father's blanket."

She appears to be an eight-year-old girl, but she was originally a beautiful vampire who had lived for more than 500 years. At the end of events of Koyomi Vamp, after Koyomi realizes that having saved his master from a certain death, leaded to a future where she will kill humans (the ""portable food"" she calls them) to ensure her survival, Koyomi revolts against Kissshot in a bloody battle to death, where Kissshot chooses not to use her full powers (in order to have a proper battle with her servant). Later on the battle it is revealed that she pretended to turn Koyomi into a human again, by letting herself be killed by Koyomi. After the shocking revelation, he cannot bring himself to kill his master who was giving her life for his, and who cared for him at the point of risking her life to save his (from sunburn) at the beginning of Spring's Break. But to prevent herself from eating more humans, Koyomi asked for help to Oshino Meme, who in the end tells that as a happy ending won't be possible for everyone, then everyone will have an unhappy ending! While Koyomi himself cannot return to be a fully human, Kissshot Acerolaorion Heartunderblade was left in a weakened condition (where she is no longer able to eat humans, and needs her servant's blood to survive) with no powers or traces of her original personality and therefore have to abandon her ""Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade"" (キスショット・アセロラオリオン・ハートアンダーブレード) name. Ever since ""Tsubasa Cat"" where she starts living in Araragi's shadow, she no longer needs to suck his blood on a regular basis in order to stay alive. She forms a physical connection with Araragi where they can feel each others emotions and senses. It is also later revealed that she can gain strength into an ""evolved"" form after sucking Araragi's blood more than the usual dosage, she does this in order to fight for Araragi when he confronts Yotsugi and Yozuru. In Mayoi Jiangshi, in the alternate timeline, Shinobu went berserk when Koyomi was killed by Black Hanekawa, feeling that she was somewhat responsible for his death, so she swore to destroy the world and created the Jiangshi that has been swarming the town. It seems that she truly cares about Koyomi and when she saw Koyomi was alive in the alternate timeline, she started weeping blood. In the end, Araragi simply states that he will die together with Shinobu. Her father named her Lola, however she went by the name Acerola.

Height: 165 cm
Weight: 55 kg

Koyomi Araragi is a third year high school student who survived a vampire attack during spring break and barely regained his human life in the time that followed as a boy with remnants of vampiric traits. He can see in the dark, his eyes turn red when he gets angry, and he heals incredibly fast. As a result, he questions his lifespan. He remains scared of morning sunlight despite the fact that it no longer has any negative effects on him.

Koyomi is a laid-back person whose only real friend at school is Tsubasa Hanekawa. He's a poor student, close to failing every class except math.

It is revealed through conversations that he's quite knowledgeable with anime; a fact even noted by Nadeko Sengoku once.

Although he is shown to be attracted to the other girls, he turns their advances down due to his loyalty to Hitagi.

Other characters seems to speculate that Koyomi is a lolicon, particularly Mayoi and Hitagi, with Hitagi thinking that Nadeko is a ""threat"" to her.

He is very noble, which is why Hitagi is attracted to him. He is willing to help others at the cost of his own life. As such, the female characters he has helped are quite attached to him. He feels most comfortable talking to Mayoi, Shinobu and, from the Second Season on, to Yotsugi about his problems.

Koyomi is the only person who thinks that his family relationship is bad, with Karen and Tsukihi thinking otherwise. His parents were revealed to be police officers.

His personality is portrayed more clearly in the novels, where his inner thoughts show him to be much more perverted and intelligent than the anime leads one to believe.

Due to events prior to
Kizumonogatari
and
Bakemonogatari
, Koyomi avoided having friends and seemed to have lost faith and trust in people and himself.

Kaiki, Deishuu;Deishuu Kaiki (貝木 泥舟);"Deishuu ""Suzuki"" Kaiki";"
Kaiki Deishuu is a conman specializing in fake apparitions.

Kaiki has a gloomy personality and subscribes to the view that there is nothing in the world that is inherently true. The only absolute in life for him is money, due to its value in providing anything he wants that isn't irreplaceable; he even believes it can readily buy concepts like love and happiness. An adept schemer, Kaiki has an opaque mind to outsiders. He is fluent in the arts of lying and subterfuge, so the reasoning behind what he says is constantly blurred. He explains his name as ""Kai,"" like a mound of clam shells, and ""Ki,"" like a dead tree.

Kaiki is an individual who prides himself in having no pride. He openly admits to being a conman and an impostor, among other things, but often this is to his advantage as a master of wordplay. He flows easily in his interactions with others, and he is willing to give and take in order to maximize profit or cut his losses as needed.

Kaiki is a fake specialist who knows about paranormal creatures, but does not personally believe in them. Instead, he manipulates those who do believe, using his knowledge to make money off of them.


In ""Nisemonogatari"" he serves as the main antagonist of the ""Karen Bee"" arc. He is identified as the one who swindled the Senjougahara family, as well as the one distributing charms among junior students of Naoetsu High School throughout ""Bakemonogatari"" and ""Nisemonogatari."" Confronted by Karen Araragi for his actions, Kaiki uses a bee apparition to incapacitate her and leaves. He is confronted in the arc's finale by Araragi Koyomi and Senjougahara Hitagi, who demand he cure Karen's curse and leave town for good. Kaiki claims that the bee apparition was a fake, a simple trick of hypnosis, and that whatever symptoms she is suffering will pass in a matter of days. He then agrees to their demands and decides to leave the town for good, though not before some choice words to Senjougahara. It is later revealed in the ""Tsukihi Phoenix"" arc that he was a colleague of Kagenui Yozuru and Oshino Meme during their days in university, having supplied the former information regarding Araragi Tsukihi.

In ""Monogatari Series: Second Season,"" he serves as the narrator and main protagonist in ""Koimonogatari."" He is hired in secret by Senjougahara to deceive the human-turned-snake god, Sengoku Nadeko, who had vowed to kill Araragi and his loved ones. Despite being prompted by Gaen Izuko to back out, Kaiki persists and narrowly succeeds in convincing Nadeko to give up her godhood and attachment to Araragi by appealing to her (well-hidden) former dream of becoming a mangaka. During the arc's resolution, just as he is about to leave town he is attacked by one of the junior high students that he scammed in ""Nisemonogatari,"" evidently tipped off by Oshino Ougi and implied to be the same student that had previously cursed Nadeko with a snake apparition.

Having survived the attack, Kaiki meets with Kanbaru Suruga during the events of ""Hanamonogatari,"" where he reveals that the ""woman of his dreams"" was Kanbaru's mother, Gaen Tooe. Gaen entrusted Kaiki with Suruga's well-being before she died; in honor of this promise, Kanbaru is the only one whom Kaiki shows unconditional kindness and never attempts to swindle. He offers Kanbaru his card—with the usual ""ghost buster"" moniker scratched off—and tells her to call him if she's ever in need. Not long afterward he sends her the mummified devil's head, which he claims was given to him by Gaen."

She styles her hair into two braids and ties them with a hair ribbon that has a cat design. She is always seen dressed in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, even outside of school days, and is rarely seen on any other type of clothing, except for a set of sleepwear which she wore during Tsubasa Cat Arc.

Hanekawa Tsubasa is Araragi's classmate and the class president. Araragi describes her as ""the class president of all class presidents."" The reason Tsubasa and Hitagi cut their hair short is because they learned Araragi likes it short.

Hanekawa currently lives with her stepfather and stepmother.


Hanekawa Family's Past:

Her biological mother was 17 years old when she got pregnant, the biological father is unknown because she apparently had many lovers. Before she gave birth to Tsubasa, she married another man who was a ""workaholic."" Right after giving birth, Tsubasa's biological mother commited suicide. The workaholic stepfather, unable to raise a child, remarried again to a woman who is Tsubasa's current mother. The workaholic father soon died from overwork and the current mother married another man who is now Tsubasa's current father.

Hanekawa Story's overview in Nekomonogatari/Bakemonogatari:

Prior to the beginning of Bakemonogatari Hanekawa was possessed by a bakeneko (mischievous spirit of a dead cat) during Golden Week due to stress over her family (see Nekomonogatari: Kuro). The matter was eventually resolved with the help of Shinobu at the cost of some of Hanekawa's memories, but the problem emerged again right before the school festival because of different stress. Araragi was told by Hanekawa's bakeneko form that she has feelings for him. In ""Tsubasa Tiger"" (Nekomonogatari: Shiro), on her way to school, she met a tiger spirit which spoke to her. Soon buildings important to Hanekawa began to mysteriously burn down and ""Black Hanekawa"" (her bakeneko form) began to take over her body every time she slept. The inevitable showdown was afoot and led to some surprising events. ""Tsubasa Tiger"" is written from the perspective of Hanekawa rather than Araragi."
Hachikuji, Mayoi;Mayoi Hachikuji (八九寺 真宵);"Mayoi ""Hachihachiji, Hachirokuji"" Hachikuji";"
Mayoi is a fifth-grade elementary school girl. She is 144cm tall and always carries a big backpack, wears a hairband, and sports ponytails. Befitting her age, Mayoi is cheerful, energetic and inquisitive. She makes a lot of spelling mistakes and has a habit of mispronouncing Koyomi's family name. On the other hand, she does not easily trust strangers, and will even fight back against them if they become too nosy.


Ten years ago she was involved in a traffic accident and died because of it. After that she became a ghost and considers herself a ""lost snail"". She unwillingly causes the people around her to become lost and unable to find their way home. The only people who can see her are people who don't want to go home in the first place. However, after Araragi and Senjougahara help her find the home she was looking for, she changed from an ""earthbound spirit"" to a ""wandering spirit"", a fact that she considers to be a bonus, as well as granting her to be free to wander wherever she desires. At the end of Nisemonogatari, she said goodbye to Koyomi, implying that she will not be seeing him again, which will be the basis of the next story, Mayoi Jiangshi. Her family name before her parents got divorced was Tsunade.

In Shinobu Time, she is chased by the darkness together with Koyomi Araragi. It is later revealed by Izuko Gaen that the darkness was targeting Hachikuji because she remained in the town even after she was saved by Koyomi. To stop the darkness, she finally decides that she must pass on. She kisses Koyomi and confesses her love for him before she vanishes."
Kanbaru, Suruga;Suruga Kanbaru (神原 駿河);Suruga  Kanbaru;"
Suruga, the main character of Suruga Monkey, is Koyomi's underclassman, star of the school's basketball team and one of Hitagi's acquaintances from back in junior high school. She is so well known in her school that not a single student had not heard of her, mostly because it was her who was responsible of the rapid rise of success of the school's girls basketball team due to her talents. She considers herself a lesbian, fujoshi, lolicon and masochist. Her hobbies include reading yaoi literature and playing basketball. Although her sexual preference is clearly towards females, she does not have a hard time interacting with males, and she even manages to say teasing remarks when she is comfortable with the person she talks to (i.e. Araragi). She is 160cm tall.

Suruga is a girl with brown eyes and dark bluish hair. Because of her club activities as a basketball varsity player, she boasts an athletic physique, although she admits that her breasts might not be ample enough for Araragi to notice.

Her clothing style reflects her boyish personality; when she is not in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, she often wears sleeveless clothing and shorts. Whichever clothes she wears, she is regularly seen wearing cycling shorts, which she considers to be her underwear, much to Araragi's shock upon hearing it straight from her (as it implies that she does not wear panties).


Hidden from others, however, is her tendency to be jealous of others to the point of thinking of causing bodily harm to them for revenge. This would eventually fuel her killing intent as the Rainy Devil. Back in elementary school, she inherited what she thought was a monkey's paw. At this time, she had been teased at for being slow in track. Because of this, Suruga decides to use the monkey's paw to grant her wish to become the fastest among her classmates. Unexpectedly, her competitors in one race she would participate in were attacked by an unknown assailant and were absent the next day. This would soon continue for some time, and this caused Suruga to be afraid, especially upon her discovery of the novel The Monkey's Paw, which tells the story of a similar item that grants wishes for a certain price. Suruga would soon shift her focus to basketball, where she immediately shone as the school's ace player, and this caused Hitagi Senjougahara, the track ace at that time, to take notice of her talent. She and Hitagi become close friends,with Kanbaru calling their pairing the Valhalla Combo (ヴァルハラコンビ Varuhara Konbi, formed by the ""varu"" from Kanbaru and ""hara"" from Senjougahara), and she soon forgot about the monkey's paw. Immediately after she entered senior high school, she became aware of Hitagi's secret and was threatened by her, just like Koyomi was. However, unlike the persistent Araragi, Kanbaru followed Hitagi's advice and stopped talking to Hitagi since that time. However, she then started stalking Koyomi after she discovered he was dating Hitagi. In Suruga Devil, there seems to be a rumor about a devil solving other people's problem. Fearing that she might be the rumored ""Devil,"" she decided to investigate and found out that the rumored Devil is actually an old basketball rival of hers named, Numachi Rouka. It seems that Kanbaru is still worried about the effects of the Rainy Devil after it has been dispersed to the point that whenever she goes to sleep, she would bind her devil's arm to a pillar so that she wouldn't start sleepwalking and committing crimes and check the newspaper everyday so that she can make sure she didn't do anything unconsciously. She also has dreams of her mother once in a while which give her weird life lessons. She is named Kanbaru Suruga now but she was previously named Gaen Suruga. Izuko is her aunt and Suruga's mother had some kind of connection to oddities as she had inherited that devil's left arm from her mother. Her mother and father were revealed to have eloped as the Kanbaru family did not agree with their relationship. Kanbaru is also the only person that Kaiki will ever treat in a good way.

Nadeko, the main character of Nadeko Snake, is Tsukihi's friend back in elementary school. She always wears a waist pouch, always casts her eyes downward, has her bangs covering her eyes, has a shy personality, and can be easily amused. Koyomi played with her a lot whenever she visited his house after being invited by his sisters. She refers to Koyomi as Koyomi onii-chan and appears to have feelings for him.


She was cursed two times by a classmate who liked the boy she rejected, and the rejected boy. While the first one is banished, Koyomi is forced to battle the second to keep it from killing Nadeko.
She's quite protective of her hair (particularly her forelocks) thinking that it's her place to guard more than her panties. When she finally combed her forelocks aside in Nisemonogatari, Koyomi commented that she has a glare just like a serpent, probably foreshadowing the story of Nadeko Medusa.


Nadeko Medusa Arc

During Halloween, Nadeko met a girl named Ougi who gave her a white scrunchie. After, she was able to see a white serpent, Kuchinawa, in the place of it. In Nadeko's class, the atmosphere has become strained and because Nadeko is the class rep, she's been pressured to do something about it. Later on, Kuchinawa tells her to go to the shrine where she last sacrificed snakes in Bakemonogatari. He commands her to atone for what she did by finding the remains of the snake god that inhabited the shrine in the past. She tries not to involve Koyomi, but he manages to find her at night and takes her to his house. She wakes up next to Tsukihi and manages to bring up the topic of Koyomi's girlfriend. Finally, Nadeko reveals her jealousy toward Hitagi, but claims that she would never try to steal him. Tsukihi says that she planned to support her if Nadeko was going to do so. However, since Nadeko instead said she doesn't want to trouble him, Tsukihi says it's as if after all these years passed, that Nadeko is using her brother as in excuse to reject boys from her school. Tsukihi loses her patience and suddenly cuts Nadeko's fringe. This way, she wouldn't be able to hide her face or emotions anymore, which she later attempts again with her teacher. Yet without her fringe, he can see that she isn't disturbed at all. Nadeko ended up very ""uncharistically"" snapping at him and after, to her classmates. The serpent then tells Nadeko that its remains are in Araragi's house, where she finds the paper charm Gaen previously trusted Koyomi with. Kuchinawa offers to grant Nadeko any wish, and she already knows what to ask for: Koyomi to love her back. She says this in front of him, but he says that her desire cannot be granted. After some of Shinobu's provocation, Nadeko eats the charm and becomes an oddity, sharing her body with Kuchinawa, and her hair turns white with each lock becoming a snake. As an oddity, Nadeko reveals her true colors: an obsessive, egotistical, cynical girl, who would not hesitate to kill in order to keep her delusional and impossible love story."
Numachi, Rouka;Rouka Numachi (沼地 蠟花);"Rouka ""Lord Devil"" Numachi";"
Rouka Numachi is the former basketball rival and supposed arch-nemesis of Suruga Kanbaru. Though she once shared an affinity for basketball akin to Suruga, albeit as a defensive player, she would go on to sustain a leg injury that would end her endeavor in sports. The two had a falling out in middle school due to Rouka's injuries causing a rift between the two.

Rouka is characterized by the concept of ""schadenfreude""; in which she derives pleasure from the misfortune of others. A self-proclaimed collector misfortunes, she enjoys listening to people's problems whilst offering empty promises of helping them out. Turning this form of counseling into a non-profit service, Rouka began to operate under the alias called ""Lord Devil""; in which she promises her customers that she can solve anyone's problems with absolute certainty.

Contrasting Suruga's virtuous nature, her desire for collecting misfortunes is one of malice. Though she genuinely sympathizes towards her customers' issues, her actions are maliciously self-beneficial and acted out with impartiality towards her customers. She justifies her sense of ""evil"" as non-harmful, as it not only benefits her state of mind while also allowing her customers to solve their own problems by simply letting the time pass. She carries a crutch due to her injury, which she described as allowing her customers to open up more easily with her.


In Hanamonogatari, it is revealed that Rouka, through her business acquaintance Kaiki Deishuu, had discovered the nature of apparitions/aberrations. When Suruga first confronted Rouka about her counseling activities as ""Lord Devil"", it is later revealed that Rouka had stolen Suruga's supposed ""monkey's paw"" (a part of the ""Rainy Devil"" apparition) during the encounter; in which she transfused it onto her own left arm. Rouka had been collecting the various body parts of the ""Rainy Devil"" apparition since she viewed its problem-solving abilities as a competitor and threat to her business. During her second confrontation with Suruga, Rouka elaborated on her motives for collecting misfortunes and ""Rainy Devil"" parts, even revealing that her current leg injury is a ruse, due to the transfused leg of the ""Rainy Devil"" negating her past disability. Upon further investigation, Suruga discovered that Rouka already died before she even graduated to high school; having committed suicide out of grief over her injuries. Suruga had actually been meeting Rouka's ghost, in which the latter had forgotten of her own death and had not yet ascended. During their final confrontation, Suruga presented the head part of the ""Rainy Devil"", not before challenging Rouka in a one-on-one basketball match with the intention of exorcising Rouka's ghost. Suruga proposed the match under the condition that if she were to win, Rouka must give up her pursuit of collecting misfortunes and ""Rainy Devil"" parts. Suruga won the match and the two expressed contentment over it, showing admiration for each other. Having forgotten what she had lost in life, Rouka mused how she was truly happy to have finally lost to Suruga before finally ascending; leaving behind her collection of ""Rainy Devil"" body parts."
Oshino, Ougi;Ougi Oshino (忍野 扇);Ougi  Oshino;"
Ougi appears as a girl with short black hair, black pupils, and pale white skin and is a junior of Koyomi Araragi at Naoetsu Private High School, as Ougi refers to Koyomi as senpai. Ougi claims to be Meme Oshino's niece.

In Hanamonogatari and Orokamonogatari, Ougi appears as a male.


At the start of Kabukimonogatari, Ougi is seen having a trivial conversation with Koyomi about traffic lights, causing him to think about Mayoi Hachikuji. When Ougi meets Nadeko at the beginning of Otorimonogatari, initially appearing to merely want to tell Nadeko to stop playing the victim, it is later revealed that Ougi is the mastermind behind tricking Nadeko into becoming a snake god. Four months after Mayoi disappears, Koyomi has a conversation with Ougi in the classroom. After that, Ougi leaves by saying there is a lot of work to do. When Koyomi asks about the job, Ougi tells him it's basically work that involves punishing liars. Koyomi encounters Ougi on his way to North Shirahebi Shrine, who then states that they had been waiting there for him since morning to offer him some words of encouragement. When Koyomi says he doesn't regret turning into a vampire, they tell him that the reason they like him is because he is easy to twist around. As Koyomi walks off towards the mountain, Ougi tells him that at the cost of losing many things, he has matured. Gaen reveals that Ougi’s true identity is Araragi Koyomi himself. She is an Oddity that Araragi created, similarly to how Hanekawa’s stress created Black Hanekawa, and Sengoku’s hallucinations created the white snake Kuchinawa. Ougi represents Araragi’s self-criticism. When Araragi saw ""Darkness"" for the first time in Shinobu Time, he realized that there is a law dictating over the world of Oddity. Araragi knows that he is too weak, too hesitant, too emotional to make harsh decisions, and he subconsciously wished for a being that can judge him, and ""correct"" everything wrong in this world. His desire came true as Oshino Ougi. In Suruga Bonhead, it is implied that male and female Ougi might be different identities or are the same oddity but reshaped depended on who the ""target"" is. Male Ougi appears to ""help"" Suruga but also still works with Araragi as his helping hand."

Being 300 years old, they are the youngest among the gems. Their hardness is 3.5, low compared to most of the other gems.

They are brittle and weak so they are not suited for battle. Despite being clumsy and ineffective they were given the job of completing an encyclopedia.

They want to find new job for Cinnabar, who patrols at night and lives distantly from the other gems.


After being consumed by the sea snail Ventricosus, they gain ability to understand her speech and decide to follow her into the ocean in hopes of finding a job that might suit Cinnabar. Ventricosus subsequently offers Phos to the Lunarians in exchange for her brother Aculeasis. Phos loses both of their legs during their capture. Aculeasis escapes the Lunarians and gifts Phos pieces of his shell, which are imbued with agate. Phos' legs are replaced by these, giving them incredible speed. After the incident at sea, Kongou-sensei decides to cancel Phos' encyclopedia job.


During winter they couldn't sleep and did not join other gems in hibernation. Kongou-sensei allowed them to join Antarcticite in their duties, primarily consisting of upkeep and destroying ice floes. Phos lost both arms when they became distracted by the floes and fell into the water. Phos and Antarcticite search for a new suitable material to replace them, and try out a gold and platinum alloy. After Antarcticite is taken by Lunarians, Phos is assigned to their previous tasks and helps Kongou-sensei throughout the rest of winter. They have difficulty sleeping, as they have nightmares about Antarcticite being shattered. Phos greatly matures over the winter and mimics some of Antarcticite's looks and mannerisms. Their new arms can become semi-fluid at will but is very heavy. As a result, Phos lost their previous speed.


In spring they temporary pair up with Bort. While on patrol they are attacked by an unusual type of Lunarian which later turns docile while in Kongou-sensei's presence.

Date of Death: November 5, 2004 (2007 in anime)
L, who also uses the aliases Hideki Ryuga, Ryuzaki, Eraldo Coil and Deneuve, the latter two for which he has developed reputations as the second—and third—best detectives in the world, is quite secretive and only communicates with the world through his assistant Watari. He never shows his face to the world, instead representing himself with a capital L in Cloister Black font. After meeting the Kira investigation team, he requests that the task force refer to him as Ryuzaki for discretion. The Kira investigation team never learns his true name.

L's disheveled and languid appearance masks his great powers of deduction and insight. He tends to second-guess everything he is presented with, and is extremely meticulous and analytical. He has several quirks such as preferring to crouch rather than sit, eating only sweet foods like desserts and fruits, and holding items very delicately. He stayed in England for five years, and during that time he was the champion in tennis for the England Junior Cup.

L suggests that even though he eats only sweet foods, he remains underweight because the brain uses the most calories of any organ in the body. He also says that if he sits normally, his reasoning ability would drop 40%.

Light, born on February 28, 1986, is a third year high school student (12th grade) at Daikoku Private Academy (大国学園, Daikoku Gakuen) who also attends supplemental classes at Gamou Prep Academy in the beginning of the story. Light has a father, Soichiro Yagami, who is the head of the Police Force. Light also has a mother, Sachiko Yagami, and a younger sister, Sayu Yagami.

In Spring 2004, Light becomes a first-year student (freshman) at To-Oh University (東応大学, Tōō Daigaku), becoming one of two freshman representatives; L is the other freshman representative. During a tennis game with L at To-Oh, spectators reveal that Light was the junior high school tennis champion in 1999 and 2000. After his 2000 victory, Light quit tennis as he entered high school.

Yagami Light is a brilliant college student. Nicknamed ""Kira,"" he uses the Death Note to create his ideal world of justice under him; its new God. Though he looks frail, Light is an extremely athletic person, with an aptitude to find an opponent's weak point. He is a genius, which adds to his notion that only he is fit to judge humanity and steer it on a proper moral course.

Perhaps neutral by nature, Ryuk often refuses to aid Light and instead enjoys watching him struggle for his goal. The most important facet of Ryuk's character is that he is not Light's friend. He acts for his own interests and entertainment, and often fails to tell Light key details about the Death Note. Ryuk is selfish, however, and will aid Light if it serves his own goals, such as providing amusement or obtaining apples.

In Death Note, Near is the youngest of L's two successors raised in Wammy's House, Watari's orphanage for gifted children, in Winchester, England, United Kingdom. Of the successors, Near is the more level-headed, calmly assessing the situation, while the other, Mello, is more emotional and quick to act. Much like L, Near shows various odd behaviors during his normal life. He is usually seen hunched over rather than sitting. He also constantly plays with various toys, which he uses in his theories, as well as idly twiddling strands of his hair. He shows a great respect for L, basing much of how he solves crime on L's methods, even to the point where he only takes cases that he is interested with rather than trying to pursue justice. Near uses the Wedding Text font ""N"" and ""L"" to represent himself and the fake L, respectively. But later in the aftermath, he used Old English font ""L"" like the original L did. He is voiced by Noriko Hidaka in the Japanese anime, Cathy Weseluck in the English dub, and Bruno Coronel in the Latin Spanish version.


It is speculated by Matsuda in Death Note: Oneshot that Near uses the Death Note to manipulate Mikami into failing Light in the final battle, which would shed light on some major plotholes. It's important to note that Tsugumi Ohba has said that he wanted it to be left up to the readers on if Matsuda is right or not.
Tsugumi Ohba, writer of Death Note, said that Near ""becomes less likeable"" as the story advances, citing Near's plan to take the notebook at a later point in the story. Ohba said that a negative reaction originated from ""the difference in their attitudes"" and that people may have viewed Near as ""a cheat."" Ohba added that Near's ""cheeky behavior,"" intended to ""reinforce his childishness,"" had been construed as ""annoying.""

In the final chapter Near brings finger puppets to the Yellow Box Warehouse. Takeshi Obata, artist of Death Note, said that Near first bought the Kira finger puppet and drew on it with a magic marker. Obata then said that Near must have created the other puppets afterwards. Obata views Near as not liking L much so Obata had Near depict L as ""ugly"", and that Near ""worked hard"" on Mello's puppet as Near ""liked Mello.""

Obata said he enjoyed drawing Near and that Near is also one of his favorite and his least favorite characters, considering him to be the smartest character in the manga ""because he cheats.""

When asked about which character was most similar to himself, Ohba indicated Near and ""maybe Light."" Regarding Near, Ohba said that he does not leave his house often."

When it is decided that Mello should work with the other successor, Near, Mello refuses, citing an inability to work with Near, to whom he is considered second. Similar to L's fondness for sweets, Mello is often seen eating bars of chocolate. How to Read 13 states that Mello has ""an excellent mind"" and that he ""sometimes lets his emotions get in his way."" The book cites Mello's ""hatred of Near,"" which created ""a flaw in [Mello's] personality."" The book states that Mello isn't purely evil, citing his apology and genuine care for Matt's well-being.

Mello decides to find Kira his own way by joining the Mafia. After obtaining one of the Death Notes from the Kira investigation team by kidnapping Sayu Yagami, Light Yagami sets up a raid that leaves Mello badly scarred and his real name in Light's hands. After learning that Light is Kira and Near was going to attempt to apprehend him, Mello kidnaps Kiyomi Takada, but is soon killed by Takada's hidden pages of the Death Note. This action causes Teru Mikami to expose his own Death Note to kill Takada, an action that Near picks up on and is eventually able to use to thwart Light's plans. Near reflects this during the final showdown and credits Mello as the single most pivotal person in discovering Light's plans. Hal Lidner further believes that it was Mello's plan that he would be killed to expose Light's plan, but Near rejects this theory. His date of death is January 26th, 2010. Age 20.

Mikami works as a lawyer, and was bullied for standing up for what is right when he was younger in school. He was an excellent student and did well academically. He became a prosecuting agent to impose the punishment that criminals deserved.

Tota is known as the most outspoken member in the investigation team. He plays a crucial role in the investigation of the Yotsuba Group after sneaking into the company's building without the knowledge of the team. His designated investigation team alias is Taro Matsui.

By following L's instructions, Matsuda gains the trust of the company's board members, fabricates his death (he uses the alias Taro Matsui) so that Yotsuba members can not kill him), and serves as a temporary decoy to lure the suspect into the Sakura television studio during the second Sakura TV incident. Despite his excitable, naïve personality, Matsuda manages to stay alive through quite a few dangerous times. Matsuda sees Soichiro as his mentor.

While it is clear that most of the investigation team views Kira as a an evil criminal, Matsuda often wonders if Kira is performing good deeds, especially since more and more people seem to be agreeing with what he does. Matsuda is scared by Mikami's intense loyalty to Kira when he hears Mikami's public announcement on Sakura TV. Matsuda proves to be somewhat supportive and sympathetic towards Kira's followers nonetheless.

When Light is revealed as Kira at Yellowbox Warehouse, Matsuda is the most shocked of the team. He has always liked Light and is outraged to learn that he had been fooled; he is particularly upset, asserting that Light's actions had led to the death of Soichiro. Matsuda succeeds in saving Near's life by shooting Light's hand, causing him to drop the pen that he was writing Near's name with. Matsuda shoots him several more times to stop Light from writing Near's name in his own blood. The enraged Matsuda nearly kills Light with a shot to the head, but he is stopped by the rest of the Japanese investigation team.

As shown in the final chapter, Matsuda suspects that, to help with Light's capture, Near has used the Death Note to control Mikami's actions before killing him, but Ide says that he has no proof and it may be a ""wish"" on his part, perhaps related to his thinking of Light as a friend.

Rem is the Shinigami who first gives Misa her Death Note and Shinigami eyes. Similar to Ryuk, Rem possesses two Death Notes; she purposely gives a Death Note to Misa. Rem inherited her second Death Note from Jealous, another Shinigami who died when he saved Misa's life, and thought it only right to pass it on to Misa. Rem inherits Jealous' love for Misa as well and is prompt to defend Misa even at the cost of her life. She shows this when she openly shows her lack of trust for Light stating that if Misa dies before her time, Rem will kill Light. In the manga and anime, Rem tells Misa that she is actually a female Shinigami. In the second live-action film, this is not mentioned, leaving it ambiguous.

Ability Parameters (out of 5): Power = 1; jump = 5; stamina = 5; intellect = 1; technique = 1; speed = 5

Hinata has an unusually high ability to jump. Since he was young, Hinata trained his legs to compensate for his lack of height. He joins Karusuno High School Volleyball team and amazes the team with his natural affinity as a spiker. Although he is a complete beginner and never had any experience playing in a volleyball team, he grows rapidly through each match.

Hinata has a cheerful and energetic personality. He's a natural schmoozer and his teammates would sometimes use him to win someone over, such as Nishinoya. Hinata gets excited easily and often talks loudly. He is the loudest member after Nishinoya and Tanaka. He is friendly and can befriend anyone easily, such as Kenma from Nekoma High and Aone from Date Tech High.

Despite his easy-going personality, Hinata is extremely competitive, especially when it comes to volleyball. As stated by Sugawara, Hinata has a very big fortitude to win and thus, doesn't give up easily during a match no matter if it's a practice match or a real match. Hinata can also exhibit a very scary and intimidating face when people underestimate him. Despite that, Hinata gets scared easily, especially by larger and stronger opponents. However, he recovers quickly and will then confidently challenge the opponents.

Ability Parameters (out of 5): Power = 4; jump = 4; stamina = 5; intellect = 5; technique = 5; speed = 4

Kageyama was initially referred to as ""King of the Court,"" a derogatory nickname that insinuates his autocratic nature, given to him by his former teammates at Kitagawa Daiichi during his late middle school days. Kageyama is widely regarded as a stunning prodigy and an absolute genius by many of the prefecture's players and coaches. After joining Karasuno, he manages to change his attitude for the better with the help of his new teammates and rediscover what it means to be part of a team.

Unbeknownst to the majority of his schoolmates and acquaintances, however, he is actually much more sensitive and childish than he appears to be; he simply does not know how to control his frustration and express his thoughts and emotions in an appropriate way.

Since joining Karasuno, he has grown to be more respectful of his upperclassmen (Sugawara and Asahi in particular), as well as more accepting of people whose abilities and/or views differ from his own, and has come to once again understand the importance of teamwork and mutual trust in the sport he treasures so much. This has also helped him regain his confidence as a setter.

Yuu is a very energetic and temperamental person. His boisterous nature and crazy shenanigans can attract unwanted attention quite easily, which often bodes ill for him. Although he hardly ever worries about the consequences of his actions (and may even revert to violence in order to vent out his anger on certain occasions), he is surprisingly considerate of his friends' feelings and insecurities.

Yuu can be extremely impatient, excitable and impulsive. As Ryuunosuke Tanaka puts it, ""he simply gets too fired up for his own good."" He doesn't bother to filter his words, and is therefore prone to blurting out whatever he's thinking in a loud and tactless manner. In-game, however, his attitude changes drastically: he becomes incredibly focused and serious, remaining calm and doing everything in his power to provide the support his team needs until the very end. For this reason, everyone in the volleyball club respects him greatly.

The captain and setter of the Aoba Jousai High School Volleyball Club. Oikawa was also Kageyama's senpai when they were attending Kitagawa Daiichi. According to Kageyama, he is a very talented setter and volleyball player with a bad personality.

Oikawa also frequently makes cheerful remarks, but follows them up with serious or intimidating afterthoughts. Despite his flirtatious and blasé exterior, Oikawa is extremely intelligent and cunning, to the point of his own teammates stating they wouldn't want to be friends with him because he figures out everyone's weakness.

He holds a grudge against Kageyama, whom he mockingly calls Tobio-chan. This is due to his feelings of inferiority when compared to Kageyama, who has been hailed as a genius setter since their time spent at Kitagawa Daiichi. Kageyama can unintentionally bring out the more childish or rash aspects of Oikawa's personality.

A member of the Karasuno High volleyball club, Tsukishima is very blunt and has a habit of riling people up (usually Hinata, Kageyama, and even his senpais Tanaka and Nishinoya). He dislikes “hot-blooded people” and doesn’t like to exert too much effort due to the past experiences of his older brother. Aside from others like Daichi, Sugawara, and Asahi, he has little to no respect for his other teammates and is shown to be quite irritated at having to be close to them (seen as Karasuno huddled up to build up their spirits and again when he expressed disgust in having to stay with the team during training camp). He can even be rude to Yamaguchi (the person closest to him) which really shows his spiteful personality. The second years think of him as someone with a warped personality. He also teases Kageyama both by calling him ""the king"" as well as referring to the rest of the players as common folk, which angers him to the core.

Kenma has a very relaxed and laid back personality. He hardly ever loses his cool, and he usually never gets excited about anything (with the exception of Hinata and video games). He is quiet and reserved and does not voice his opinions often since he is afraid of how others would think of them. He isn't the type who can make friends easily, and his only friend back when he was younger had been Tetsurou Kuroo. Despite his modest personality, Kenma is actually quite skilled in volleyball, with his extraordinary game sense and technique, which makes up for his power, speed, and stamina.

Being the vice captain, he has a soothing personality for his teammates and acts as a pillar of support for them. Even though he isn't Karasuno's official setter anymore, he doesn't dream of giving up on playing in general. As such, he encourages himself and all of his teammates not to give up, no matter how rough the situation might be.

Sugawara's dedication to volleyball is clear when he decides to continue club activities even when most third years choose to retire to focus on their futures. In a meeting, his teacher asked Sugawara why he's so determined to continue playing even though he's not a starting member, and Sugawara replied that he doesn't want to have regrets in the future.

He is also quite perceptive as he noticed how Tanaka asked for the key to the gym (back during the first years's 3-on-3 match) even though he always comes in late, so Sugawara knew that something was up. He is also intelligent as he can come up with helpful tactics during the game. An example of this is when he came up with the idea of saying ""bring it"" and ""send it to me"" for Kageyama and Hinata's combo.

Bokuto Koutaro is a 3rd year Captain and Wing Spiker of Fukurodani Volleyball Team. Together with Kuroo, he teaches Tsukishima Kei Volleyball despite the fact that Karasuno High is a formidable opponent.

He has a playful, energetic and child-like personality and is described by his team as having mood swings, where even the slightest thing can change his mood which then impacts his performance. He is often referred to as 'simple-minded' because of this, but is both admired by his own team and the opponents for his impressive skills and morale-boosting demeanor.

When he makes a comeback, he clearly shows his pride as the ace and believes he is the 'strongest'. Bokuto is energetic (similar to Hinata), often making jokes about everything and acting rather dramatically about his plays. His personality is so compatible that he gets along with many people. However, he's rather ignorant to other people's discomfort, such as with Tsukishima.

Askeladd was contracted by Floki to assassinate Thors, Thorfinn's father. Thorfinn became obsessed with avenging his father and joined Askeladd's band with the sole intent of killing him in a fair fight, but is always outclassed by Askeladd's combat skill.

Askeladd is a tactical genius and a master swordsman. His ability to manipulate those around him turned a horde of pirates and raiders into a close-knit group loyal to him, as well as proving him capable of turning enemies into allies, as seen with Thorfinn, Thorkell, and Prince Canute.

This same love of war leads him to support Prince Canute's bid for kingship of the Danes. Before Thors' defection he works with and highly respects the man, and bears a fondness for his son Thorfinn in the main plot. He duels twice with Thorfinn and dominates each time, though he loses two fingers in the first duel and an eye in the second. In battle, Thorkell typically wields a pair of axes as his primary weapons, but his greatest asset is probably his vast physical strength. During a skirmish with Askeladd's band, he hurled a spear with such force that it skewered three man at once, despite having been thrown from several hundred feet away. Thorkell's character is based on Thorkell the Tall, a historical Jomsviking lord who is a mentor to Canute in the Flateyjarbók.

Before he can arrive at the theater of war he is betrayed by a former comrade, Floki, who hires Askeladd to assassinate him. Thors is largely considered the greatest fighter to appear in the series, having defeated the likes of Askeladd and Thorkell in single combat.

Though he is known as the figurehead of the Great Tokyo Empire—which was established after the destruction of Neo-Tokyo—Tetsuo is actually the one in charge and he uses Akira to perform miracles with his power to control their followers.

She appears to be an eight-year-old girl, but she was originally a beautiful vampire who had lived for more than 500 years. At the end of events of Koyomi Vamp, after Koyomi realizes that having saved his master from a certain death, leaded to a future where she will kill humans (the ""portable food"" she calls them) to ensure her survival, Koyomi revolts against Kissshot in a bloody battle to death, where Kissshot chooses not to use her full powers (in order to have a proper battle with her servant). Later on the battle it is revealed that she pretended to turn Koyomi into a human again, by letting herself be killed by Koyomi. After the shocking revelation, he cannot bring himself to kill his master who was giving her life for his, and who cared for him at the point of risking her life to save his (from sunburn) at the beginning of Spring's Break. But to prevent herself from eating more humans, Koyomi asked for help to Oshino Meme, who in the end tells that as a happy ending won't be possible for everyone, then everyone will have an unhappy ending! While Koyomi himself cannot return to be a fully human, Kissshot Acerolaorion Heartunderblade was left in a weakened condition (where she is no longer able to eat humans, and needs her servant's blood to survive) with no powers or traces of her original personality and therefore have to abandon her ""Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade"" (キスショット・アセロラオリオン・ハートアンダーブレード) name. Ever since ""Tsubasa Cat"" where she starts living in Araragi's shadow, she no longer needs to suck his blood on a regular basis in order to stay alive. She forms a physical connection with Araragi where they can feel each others emotions and senses. It is also later revealed that she can gain strength into an ""evolved"" form after sucking Araragi's blood more than the usual dosage, she does this in order to fight for Araragi when he confronts Yotsugi and Yozuru. In Mayoi Jiangshi, in the alternate timeline, Shinobu went berserk when Koyomi was killed by Black Hanekawa, feeling that she was somewhat responsible for his death, so she swore to destroy the world and created the Jiangshi that has been swarming the town. It seems that she truly cares about Koyomi and when she saw Koyomi was alive in the alternate timeline, she started weeping blood.

Koyomi Araragi is a third year high school student who survived a vampire attack during spring break and barely regained his human life in the time that followed as a boy with remnants of vampiric traits. He can see in the dark, his eyes turn red when he gets angry, and he heals incredibly fast. As a result, he questions his lifespan. He remains scared of morning sunlight despite the fact that it no longer has any negative effects on him.

Koyomi is a laid-back person whose only real friend at school is Tsubasa Hanekawa. He's a poor student, close to failing every class except math.

It is revealed through conversations that he's quite knowledgeable with anime; a fact even noted by Nadeko Sengoku once.

Although he is shown to be attracted to the other girls, he turns their advances down due to his loyalty to Hitagi.

Other characters seems to speculate that Koyomi is a lolicon, particularly Mayoi and Hitagi, with Hitagi thinking that Nadeko is a ""threat"" to her.

He is very noble, which is why Hitagi is attracted to him. He is willing to help others at the cost of his own life. As such, the female characters he has helped are quite attached to him. He feels most comfortable talking to Mayoi, Shinobu and, from the Second Season on, to Yotsugi about his problems.

Koyomi is the only person who thinks that his family relationship is bad, with Karen and Tsukihi thinking otherwise. His parents were revealed to be police officers.

His personality is portrayed more clearly in the novels, where his inner thoughts show him to be much more perverted and intelligent than the anime leads one to believe.

Due to events prior to
Kizumonogatari
and
Bakemonogatari
, Koyomi avoided having friends and seemed to have lost faith and trust in people and himself.

She is so well known in her school that not a single student had not heard of her, mostly because it was her who was responsible of the rapid rise of success of the school's girls basketball team due to her talents. She considers herself a lesbian, fujoshi, lolicon and masochist. Her hobbies include reading yaoi literature and playing basketball. Although her sexual preference is clearly towards females, she does not have a hard time interacting with males, and she even manages to say teasing remarks when she is comfortable with the person she talks to (i.e. Araragi). She is 160cm tall.

Suruga is a girl with brown eyes and dark bluish hair. Because of her club activities as a basketball varsity player, she boasts an athletic physique, although she admits that her breasts might not be ample enough for Araragi to notice.

Her clothing style reflects her boyish personality; when she is not in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, she often wears sleeveless clothing and shorts. Whichever clothes she wears, she is regularly seen wearing cycling shorts, which she considers to be her underwear, much to Araragi's shock upon hearing it straight from her (as it implies that she does not wear panties).


Hidden from others, however, is her tendency to be jealous of others to the point of thinking of causing bodily harm to them for revenge. This would eventually fuel her killing intent as the Rainy Devil. Back in elementary school, she inherited what she thought was a monkey's paw. At this time, she had been teased at for being slow in track. Because of this, Suruga decides to use the monkey's paw to grant her wish to become the fastest among her classmates. Unexpectedly, her competitors in one race she would participate in were attacked by an unknown assailant and were absent the next day. This would soon continue for some time, and this caused Suruga to be afraid, especially upon her discovery of the novel The Monkey's Paw, which tells the story of a similar item that grants wishes for a certain price. Suruga would soon shift her focus to basketball, where she immediately shone as the school's ace player, and this caused Hitagi Senjougahara, the track ace at that time, to take notice of her talent. She and Hitagi become close friends,with Kanbaru calling their pairing the Valhalla Combo (ヴァルハラコンビ Varuhara Konbi, formed by the ""varu"" from Kanbaru and ""hara"" from Senjougahara), and she soon forgot about the monkey's paw. Immediately after she entered senior high school, she became aware of Hitagi's secret and was threatened by her, just like Koyomi was. However, unlike the persistent Araragi, Kanbaru followed Hitagi's advice and stopped talking to Hitagi since that time. However, she then started stalking Koyomi after she discovered he was dating Hitagi. In Suruga Devil, there seems to be a rumor about a devil solving other people's problem. Fearing that she might be the rumored ""Devil,"" she decided to investigate and found out that the rumored Devil is actually an old basketball rival of hers named, Numachi Rouka. It seems that Kanbaru is still worried about the effects of the Rainy Devil after it has been dispersed to the point that whenever she goes to sleep, she would bind her devil's arm to a pillar so that she wouldn't start sleepwalking and committing crimes and check the newspaper everyday so that she can make sure she didn't do anything unconsciously. She also has dreams of her mother once in a while which give her weird life lessons. She is named Kanbaru Suruga now but she was previously named Gaen Suruga. Izuko is her aunt and Suruga's mother had some kind of connection to oddities as she had inherited that devil's left arm from her mother. Her mother and father were revealed to have eloped as the Kanbaru family did not agree with their relationship. Kanbaru is also the only person that Kaiki will ever treat in a good way.

Oshino, Ougi;Ougi Oshino (忍野 扇);Ougi  Oshino;"
Ougi appears as a girl with short black hair, black pupils, and pale white skin and is a junior of Koyomi Araragi at Naoetsu Private High School, as Ougi refers to Koyomi as senpai. Ougi claims to be Meme Oshino's niece.

In Hanamonogatari and Orokamonogatari, Ougi appears as a male.


At the start of Kabukimonogatari, Ougi is seen having a trivial conversation with Koyomi about traffic lights, causing him to think about Mayoi Hachikuji. When Ougi meets Nadeko at the beginning of Otorimonogatari, initially appearing to merely want to tell Nadeko to stop playing the victim, it is later revealed that Ougi is the mastermind behind tricking Nadeko into becoming a snake god. Four months after Mayoi disappears, Koyomi has a conversation with Ougi in the classroom. After that, Ougi leaves by saying there is a lot of work to do. When Koyomi asks about the job, Ougi tells him it's basically work that involves punishing liars. Koyomi encounters Ougi on his way to North Shirahebi Shrine, who then states that they had been waiting there for him since morning to offer him some words of encouragement. When Koyomi says he doesn't regret turning into a vampire, they tell him that the reason they like him is because he is easy to twist around. As Koyomi walks off towards the mountain, Ougi tells him that at the cost of losing many things, he has matured. Gaen reveals that Ougi’s true identity is Araragi Koyomi himself. She is an Oddity that Araragi created, similarly to how Hanekawa’s stress created Black Hanekawa, and Sengoku’s hallucinations created the white snake Kuchinawa. Ougi represents Araragi’s self-criticism. When Araragi saw ""Darkness"" for the first time in Shinobu Time, he realized that there is a law dictating over the world of Oddity. Araragi knows that he is too weak, too hesitant, too emotional to make harsh decisions, and he subconsciously wished for a being that can judge him, and ""correct"" everything wrong in this world. His desire came true as Oshino Ougi. In Suruga Bonhead, it is implied that male and female Ougi might be different identities or are the same oddity but reshaped depended on who the ""target"" is. Male Ougi appears to ""help"" Suruga but also still works with Araragi as his helping hand."
Ononoki, Yotsugi;Yotsugi Ononoki (斧乃木 余接);Yotsugi  Ononoki;"
Yotsugi was first introduced in Tsukihi Phoenix. She is Yozuru's shikigami. She always addresses herself with the masculine first-person pronoun boku and thinks of Yozuru as her sister. She has an ability called Unlimited Rulebook where she can shape-shift her finger.

She seems to know about Koyomi's past as she calls him ""Devil Boy"" (鬼いちゃん, Oni-chan).

She tends to end the things she says with ""I said, with a posed look"" (僕はキメ顔でそう言った, Boku wa kime-gao de sou itta).


After being defeated by Shinobu Oshino, she stops saying it. In Koimonogatari series, she started saying ""Yaaay"" when she first met Kaiki, but he really hated it and she stopped doing so, and started talking normally.

Yotsugi was once a human and was resurrected as a tsukumogami by Yozuru. In Nisemonogatari, Shinobu Oshino mentions that Yozuru ""probably is using the name to bind her (Yotsugi)."" and she was a supernatural creature ""that took on human form.""

She and Kagenui are specialists who specialize in immortal creatures thus they try to kill Tsukihi Araragi who is immortal and is a ""monster,"" an ""Evil Phoenix."" She was defeated by a powered up Shinobu."

Hitagi, the main female character of
Bakemonogatari
, is a weak-looking girl with an ""incurable disease."" She is in the same class as Koyomi, but he has almost never heard her speak. When she was in the first year of high school, she encountered a mysterious crab, after which she became nearly weightless. Ever since then, she has avoided contact with everyone else, threatening everyone who discovers her secret. She called herself a tsundere and always speaks in an abusive style.


At the end of Mayoi Snail, she admits that she loves Koyomi, and subsequently enters into a relationship with him. After the events in Tsukihi Phoenix, she overcomes all of her trauma, and becomes a rather cheerful and normal girl. She starts calling Araragi with a cute nickname, chuckling at small things and sending e-mails full of emoticons, although her sharp tongue is still there, but toned down. She also seems to have a father complex as she becomes excited to the point of being unable to fall asleep when using her father's blanket."

Favorite phrase/slogan: ""I don't know everything, I just know what I know."" (何でもは知らないわよ。知ってることだけ。, Nandemo wa shiranaiwa yo. Shitteru koto dake.)

She styles her hair into two braids and ties them with a hair ribbon that has a cat design. She is always seen dressed in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, even outside of school days, and is rarely seen on any other type of clothing, except for a set of sleepwear which she wore during Tsubasa Cat Arc.

Hanekawa Tsubasa is Araragi's classmate and the class president. Araragi describes her as ""the class president of all class presidents."" The reason Tsubasa and Hitagi cut their hair short is because they learned Araragi likes it short.

Hanekawa currently lives with her stepfather and stepmother.


Hanekawa Family's Past:

Her biological mother was 17 years old when she got pregnant, the biological father is unknown because she apparently had many lovers. Before she gave birth to Tsubasa, she married another man who was a ""workaholic."" Right after giving birth, Tsubasa's biological mother commited suicide. The workaholic stepfather, unable to raise a child, remarried again to a woman who is Tsubasa's current mother. The workaholic father soon died from overwork and the current mother married another man who is now Tsubasa's current father.

Hanekawa Story's overview in Nekomonogatari/Bakemonogatari:

Prior to the beginning of Bakemonogatari Hanekawa was possessed by a bakeneko (mischievous spirit of a dead cat) during Golden Week due to stress over her family (see Nekomonogatari: Kuro). The matter was eventually resolved with the help of Shinobu at the cost of some of Hanekawa's memories, but the problem emerged again right before the school festival because of different stress. Araragi was told by Hanekawa's bakeneko form that she has feelings for him. In ""Tsubasa Tiger"" (Nekomonogatari: Shiro), on her way to school, she met a tiger spirit which spoke to her. Soon buildings important to Hanekawa began to mysteriously burn down and ""Black Hanekawa"" (her bakeneko form) began to take over her body every time she slept. The inevitable showdown was afoot and led to some surprising events. ""Tsubasa Tiger"" is written from the perspective of Hanekawa rather than Araragi."
Hachikuji, Mayoi;Mayoi Hachikuji (八九寺 真宵);"Mayoi ""Hachihachiji, Hachirokuji"" Hachikuji";"
Mayoi is a fifth-grade elementary school girl. She is 144cm tall and always carries a big backpack, wears a hairband, and sports ponytails. Befitting her age, Mayoi is cheerful, energetic and inquisitive. She makes a lot of spelling mistakes and has a habit of mispronouncing Koyomi's family name. On the other hand, she does not easily trust strangers, and will even fight back against them if they become too nosy.


Ten years ago she was involved in a traffic accident and died because of it. After that she became a ghost and considers herself a ""lost snail"". She unwillingly causes the people around her to become lost and unable to find their way home. The only people who can see her are people who don't want to go home in the first place. However, after Araragi and Senjougahara help her find the home she was looking for, she changed from an ""earthbound spirit"" to a ""wandering spirit"", a fact that she considers to be a bonus, as well as granting her to be free to wander wherever she desires. At the end of Nisemonogatari, she said goodbye to Koyomi, implying that she will not be seeing him again, which will be the basis of the next story, Mayoi Jiangshi. Her family name before her parents got divorced was Tsunade.

In Shinobu Time, she is chased by the darkness together with Koyomi Araragi. It is later revealed by Izuko Gaen that the darkness was targeting Hachikuji because she remained in the town even after she was saved by Koyomi. To stop the darkness, she finally decides that she must pass on. She kisses Koyomi and confesses her love for him before she vanishes."

Nadeko, the main character of Nadeko Snake, is Tsukihi's friend back in elementary school. She always wears a waist pouch, always casts her eyes downward, has her bangs covering her eyes, has a shy personality, and can be easily amused. Koyomi played with her a lot whenever she visited his house after being invited by his sisters. She refers to Koyomi as Koyomi onii-chan and appears to have feelings for him.


She was cursed two times by a classmate who liked the boy she rejected, and the rejected boy. While the first one is banished, Koyomi is forced to battle the second to keep it from killing Nadeko.
She's quite protective of her hair (particularly her forelocks) thinking that it's her place to guard more than her panties. When she finally combed her forelocks aside in Nisemonogatari, Koyomi commented that she has a glare just like a serpent, probably foreshadowing the story of Nadeko Medusa.


Nadeko Medusa Arc

During Halloween, Nadeko met a girl named Ougi who gave her a white scrunchie. After, she was able to see a white serpent, Kuchinawa, in the place of it. In Nadeko's class, the atmosphere has become strained and because Nadeko is the class rep, she's been pressured to do something about it. Later on, Kuchinawa tells her to go to the shrine where she last sacrificed snakes in Bakemonogatari. He commands her to atone for what she did by finding the remains of the snake god that inhabited the shrine in the past. She tries not to involve Koyomi, but he manages to find her at night and takes her to his house. She wakes up next to Tsukihi and manages to bring up the topic of Koyomi's girlfriend. Finally, Nadeko reveals her jealousy toward Hitagi, but claims that she would never try to steal him. Tsukihi says that she planned to support her if Nadeko was going to do so. However, since Nadeko instead said she doesn't want to trouble him, Tsukihi says it's as if after all these years passed, that Nadeko is using her brother as in excuse to reject boys from her school. Tsukihi loses her patience and suddenly cuts Nadeko's fringe. This way, she wouldn't be able to hide her face or emotions anymore, which she later attempts again with her teacher. Yet without her fringe, he can see that she isn't disturbed at all. Nadeko ended up very ""uncharistically"" snapping at him and after, to her classmates. The serpent then tells Nadeko that its remains are in Araragi's house, where she finds the paper charm Gaen previously trusted Koyomi with. Kuchinawa offers to grant Nadeko any wish, and she already knows what to ask for: Koyomi to love her back. She says this in front of him, but he says that her desire cannot be granted. After some of Shinobu's provocation, Nadeko eats the charm and becomes an oddity, sharing her body with Kuchinawa, and her hair turns white with each lock becoming a snake. As an oddity, Nadeko reveals her true colors: an obsessive, egotistical, cynical girl, who would not hesitate to kill in order to keep her delusional and impossible love story."

Due to his vast knowledge of supernatural studies and general oddities, he serves as Araragi's informant during his stay in the city.

Oshino is a graduate of Shinto studies in college, although he never pursued the career of being a Shinto priest. Despite that, he is perfectly capable to accomplish spiritual works of a Shinto priest, such as exorcising entities and solving paranormal mysteries. He occasionally wears a Priest's outfit, as seen with the session with Senjougahara and the heavy crab. Meme's other notable accessories include an earring on his right ear and a necklace, both consisting of an inverted cross."

While Subaru tends to not read the situation, he is loyal to those he holds dear, willing to help them, even if that means taking the thorny path. He has his resolve confirmed through the many situations and circumstances he faces in the fantasy world, originally having been one to always take the ""easy"" route. As a hikikomori, he is hopeful of the possibilities that being sucked into a new realm brings, but later realizes the realities of the predicament he is in. Ultimately, he resolves himself to be faithful and protective of the ones that he cares most about.

Kino;Kino  (キノ);Kino  ;"
Kino is the lead character in the story and is described as being around 15 years old with short black hair, large eyes and a fearless face. Kino usually wears a black jacket, brown overcoat, white shirt, goggled cap and wide belt with lots of pouches—using special gear depending on the weather or season as necessary. Kino travels with the motorrad, Hermes. The two have a contract—Kino provides the balance, Hermes provides the speed, and together they can travel anywhere they wish. Kino is an excellent marksman with deadly speed and accuracy, and is typically armed with two large-caliber pistols. On the journeys with Hermes, they both try and stay neutral to the situations they come across and avoid getting into other people's business.


It is revealed in episode 4 of the anime and the final chapter of volume 1 of the light novel series that Kino is a female. Her name ""Kino"" is actually the name of the traveler who saved her as a child and caused her to take to her current lifestyle. Her actual birth name is left unstated throughout both the show and LN but there are implications in the anime that it is ""Sakura."""
Hermes;Hermes  (エルメス);Hermes  ;"
Hermes is a Brough Superior motorrad (a two-wheeled vehicle that cannot fly but moves in the direction it's pointed—in other words, a motorcycle) who travels around with Kino. Hermes provides the speed that allows them to go anywhere they wish. Aside from his speed and capacity for toting about large amounts of luggage (Kino never seems to travel light), Hermes doesn't really have many other qualities except for constantly mixing up quotes and complaining. He is also rather gullible, trusting Kino absolutely even when Kino is teasing him, which leads him to grumble and complain some more. Perhaps his most famous line is ""I'm bored."" The motorrad is in many ways naive and innocent, and acts very child-like, which tends to be a sharp contrast to Kino's more mature and worldly bearing. Still, Hermes is quite reliable and makes a good companion for long trips.

In the Gakuen Kino off-shot series, he takes the form of a cell phone strap instead.

While taking the paraplegic and seemingly catatonic Yasumi for a walk, Nomiya overhears the sounds of Togawa playing basketball. Starved for playing time, Nomiya challenges Togawa to a game and comes away impressed by Togawa's skill and determination. Soon, Nomiya becomes something of a cheerleader/mascot for the Tigers and a friend to Togawa. Even though he rarely gets a chance to actually play basketball, it seems to be enough for Nomiya to be around others that do.


Nomiya later in the series tries to join professional basketball team, he leaves strong impression but in the end he is not chosen. Some time after that he gains weight and slowly starts to lose his will. He is left wondering if this is the end of his basketball career. Nomiya spends much of his time in the manga wondering where he went wrong, and trying to fix his life—inspired by the Tigers' spirit, he shaves his head and goes on something of a monk-like quest to change his fate. Against all odds, his desire to change and positive attitude seem to be rubbing off on his co-workers and acquaintances.

Togawa, Kiyoharu;Kiyoharu Togawa (戸川 清春);"Kiyoharu ""Vince"" Togawa";"
Forced to spend all of his free time after school practicing the piano, Togawa was something of an outcast to the rest of his junior high classmates. During the last PE class of the first semester, Togawa agrees to race the 100M dash against the fastest boy in his class and nearly beats him, earning an invitation to the school's track team. Togawa soon dedicates his life to becoming the fastest sprinter in the nation, but just as his goal seems in reach, he is diagnosed with osteosarcoma and loses his right leg below the knee. Togawa spends much of his time after the amputation in isolation, feeling his life is over until meeting Tora, an older man with an identical disability. Tora, a cool jet-setting tattoo artist, serves as a mentor to Togawa and introduces him to the world of wheelchair basketball through his team the Tigers. Togawa is a fiercely competitive player, and once left the team because he felt the other players weren't as serious as he was. Missing the game, Togawa returns to the Tigers, yet provokes a team mutiny early in the series because of his often ""unrealistic expectations."" Further conflicts arise when Togawa is offered a spot on the Japanese national team and is invited to join the Dream, the Tigers' arch-rivals. Togawa is rated a ""4.5"" on the wheelchair basketball point scale."
Takahashi, Hisanobu;Hisanobu Takahashi (高橋 久信);Hisanobu  Takahashi;"
At the start of the manga, Takahashi is a typical high school alpha male—captain of the basketball team, popular with girls, effortlessly smart, and a bully to other ""inferior"" students. In an effort to give his girlfriend a ride home after school, he steals a bicycle, is chased into traffic, and is hit by a garbage truck, rendering him paralyzed from the chest down. Realizing that his popular days are over, Takahashi feels that he has nothing to live for, and that he has dropped from an ""A"" class person to lower than an ""E"" class (Takahashi is obsessed with ranking the people around him—in ranks from A to E, with A being the best). Nomiya, a former teammate, is one of the few visitors Takahashi receives, and the visit is initially enough to upset Takahashi and inspire him to rehabilitate. After realizing he will never recover, however, Takahashi gives up and refuses to help himself, even going so far as to tell his mother to die and never come back. The hospital staff calls Takahashi's father, hoping that a visit to the country will help in his recovery, but Takahashi hasn't seen his father in eight years and the visit remains highly uncomfortable. After spending time with his father, Takahashi breaks down and admits that he has a lot of unexplored anger and resentment toward his father for abandoning the family.

Yama meets Togawa in the same time as Tora. He is also in the Tigers' team and introduces Togawa to it. Yama has an illness that makes him lose little by little the use of his muscles.

Yama was the manager of the Hanazawa Middle School track team before his illness prevented him from. He knows every national 100m race winner, even stating that the last one was won by Togawa as, before he stopped because of his leg, he ""ran the fastest"". He talks to Togawa about his illness (saying he will not live after 20) without being resentful, what Togawa doesn’t understand, being depressive after his own operation. Yama tells him that ""nobody knows why we're alive. We don't have time to bother"".

When Yama can hardly go out of his home, Togawa often visits him, always with a remainder of the Tigers, and Yama is always cheerful about it. He once assumed Azumi and Togawa were together, saying they were ""a nice couple"" and asking about their engagement, embarrassing them both.

As the disease progresses, Yama becomes very negative and bitter, making Togawa distressed. To help him, Togawa tells him how much of a hero he is to him, showing so much normality when he knew he was doomed, and helping him too."
Tora, Katsuta;Katsuta Tora ;Katsuta  Tora;"
Tora is a tattooist and a player for the Tigers' team in its beginnings. He has a huge tiger tattoo on his back, reminding of his name which also means ""tiger"". He is the one making Togawa stand up for himself and fight in life after his amputation.

Tora is a jolly character full of strength. Like Togawa, he has a ""rotation"" for his amputated leg, but that doesn't seem to faze him. He meets Togawa while this one is performing a check for his operation, and knows already his name, barely introducing himself and telling Togawa to use a wheelchair before speeding away. When Yama takes Togawa to one of the Tigers' session, Tora's strength and speed astonish him, when he thought he could no longer feel anything that could compete with the feelings he had while running.

When Togawa comes back to see the Tigers after crying after Azumi, Tora states it's ""good, excellent"" (the crying after a girl, while Togawa tries denying everything), puzzling everyone, then makes Togawa drive a wheelchair, integrating him by making him chasing them while he knows Togawa isn't good with wheeling a chair, thus considering him equal to the rest.

He then brings him to his tattoo shop, where Togawa has a fright given that Tora's apprentices mistake Togawa for Tora and pounce on him. Getting him a bit drunk, Tora manages to make Togawa spill everything he has bottled up since his amputation, particularly his feelings towards his father, feeling he is ""nothing but a baggage to him"". Once he's finished, Tora tells him to fight for himself no matter the judgment of others, and gives him his basketball wheelchair, as ""brother with the same leg"". The day after, Togawa asks him for a star tattoo on his chest, as proof for his new life, being the last client of Tora's shop, considering Tora is going to travel around the world right after.

Tora is indubitably the one that had the biggest influence on the turn of Togawa's life right after his amputation, showing him the world doesn't end after this. This is in his memory that Togawa doesn't want the Tigers to end or even leaving them, though the Dreams' manager, a national team, wants him to."

Azumi is Togawa's childhood friend.

At the time, it seems they liked each other a lot, Togawa promising himself to tell her ""when [he] beats 11 seconds"". Unfortunately, this race was the last one he participated to as the sarcoma in his leg prevented him from finishing it, thus, not beating 11 seconds. With him in the athletic class, she was the only one to stubbornly persist in visiting him, though his father close them up from anyone's eye, to protect his son.

After his meeting with Tora, he accepts her presence showing her his amputated leg, and she surprises him when she names the procedure, indicating him she did research about it.

She is the Tigers' manager, often playing the peacemaker between Togawa and his teammates, given he has temper.

She met Nomiya in driving school, where she admits she is trying to have her licence so that she can drive Togawa to games and practices.

She is shy and self conscious, though can get quite angry (in her thoughts) when Togawa doesn't acknowledge her efforts with dealing with him."

Family: Misuzu Osaki (mother)
Miyuki Osaki (grandmother, also foster mother—deceased)
Misato Uehara (half-sister)

One of the titular characters of the series, Osaki Nana may look like a tough punk rocker, but she has a kind heart and is a devoted friend. Abandoned by her parents and raised by her grandmother, Nana was expelled from high school after she was falsely accused of prostitution. Despite these hardships, Nana ""polishes the shards of her dreams"" and is determined to be successful as the lead vocalist of Blast. She is now engaged to her first love, Ren, although she also has lingering, ambiguous feelings for Yasu. Nana's favourite things never change. Her favorite designer is Vivienne Westwood, and her favorite band is the Sex Pistols. She smokes Seven Stars and likes coffee with milk and strawberry cake. She also has the ability to cook, but prepares all her food with too much salt which only Ren seems to enjoy.


In recent chapters, Nana had started getting panic attacks due to stressful situations, causing her to have trouble breathing. This usually had to be remedied by putting a bag over her mouth to circulate carbon dioxide and regulate her breathing. Hachi wasn't aware of this problem until Chapter 81, where she helped Nana's breathing giving her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, providing her carbon dioxide.

Komatsu, Nana;Nana Komatsu (小松 奈々);"Nana ""Hachi, Hachiko"" Komatsu";"
Born: November 30, 1980
Height: 158 cm
Weight: 46 kg
Family: Mother (Natsuko), Father, Older sister (Nao) and younger sister (Nami).

Komatsu came to Tokyo, looking to find her dream. Unlike Osaki, Komatsu came from a large and happy household, though her childish outlook prevented her from living on her own initially. She's the middle child of three sisters.

Her chance encounter with Osaki began a friendship which changes Komatsu's life forever. She is introduced to Osaki's band, Black Stones, and their members. She later even helps ""Blast"" to find their bassist, by drawing a poster to advertise the vacancy. Much to her surprise, she also discovers that the members of Blast were friends with the members of Trapnest, a popular rock band of which she's a very big fan.


Nana Komatsu discovers she is pregnant (revealed in chapters 25 and 26), and although she really loves Nobuo, she realizes that Takumi would be in a better position to care for her and her unborn child. She also chooses to be with Takumi because she knows that the only way Nobu would be able to care for it would be to give up playing with Blast and return to his family's inn. She doesn't want him to give up his dream, plus she wants Blast to become famous and popular more than anything. Nana K. clings to Takumi's calm attitude towards her pregnancy, and she is given strength through his kindness at that time. Because of her pregnancy, she marries Takumi (initially in name only, for Takumi delayed their wedding because of Osaki's engagement to Ren). Her married name throughout the series is Nana Ichinose. As the time passes, she realizes she loves Takumi. Takumi's compliments on her cooking when they first met encourages her to improve her cooking even more and take cooking classes. She makes breakfast for Takumi everyday and draws a funny face on it with ketchup, usually stating her mood to Takumi. They both seem to have a mundane married relationship, with quarrels and making up due to her naive and forgiving nature and Takumi's forgetful nonchalant nature. She hopes that she will be able to live happily, although in the future sequences of NANA she lives in Japan while he lives in London, England.

Shinichi Okazaki is the bass player of Blast, and youngest member of the band, being only 15 years old.

Shin was born in Sweden, he speaks British English with a Swedish accent. Due to his dysfunctional family, Shin left his home and abandoned his original family name.


He moonlights as a male prostitute, with Reira being one of his clients. Among other things, he is an expert mahjong player and a confidant and early roommate to Nobu. After being threatened by Takumi, he stops seeing Reira to protect her status and his own feelings. Ryouko Kawashigi, one of his older clients, bears a striking resemblance to Reira and he sees her again after the two musicians ended their relationship. She lives near his parents' apartment, works as a stewardess, and is the one that taught Shin ""bad things"". He and Ryouko were put under arrest for possession of marijuana which caused BLAST to withdraw from their tour. In the future it is shown he has become an actor."

Blood type: A (II)

He is the guitarist of Blast; attended the same high school as Nana Osaki. He is friendly and optimistic, but at times, he tends to miss the focus of conversations around him. Before Nana's ""smoking ban"", he is the only non-smoking member of Blast. But, his poor threshold for alcohol meant that he leaked many secrets while he is drunk (most notably, about Nana and Ren's relationship to Shin). Like Yasushi, Nobu comes from a rich family (his parents own an inn). Despite this, he is still very passionate about music, even sharing Osaki's dream of making it big with a band one day.


He falls in love with Hachi and they start a short but happy relationship. When Takumi tells Nobu about her pregnancy, Hachi painfully leaves him for Takumi. While he eventually accepts the reasons why she left him, he still fears the possibility of the child being his and he continues to have feelings for Hachi."
Takagi, Yasushi;Yasushi Takagi (高木 泰士);"Yasushi ""Yasu"" Takagi";"
He plays percussion and is the leader of Blast, usually handling the business partnerships and financial decisions needed for the band's success. His favorite cigarette brand is ""Black Stones"", from which the band got their name. He is also a lawyer in training, despite his ""scary"" appearance (clean shaven head, many earrings and dark glasses). He's the big brother figure for Nana O—and sometimes Nobu—and acted as Nana's ""guardian"" when she arrived in Tokyo. While he harbors some feelings for her, he baits Ren to rekindle their love for each other. In the past, he shared several ties with Trapnest's members. Yasu and Ren grew up in the same orphanage and remained close friends when Yasu was adopted. He dated Reira while in high school and was jealous of Takumi's success and influence on her, which he later relates as the reasons for their break up. Also, he's the oldest member of Blast which Nobu sometimes teases him about (by calling him ""old man""). He is in a budding romance with Miu to the surprise of Ren and others—who were sure he would date Reira again.


He is also in love with Nana.

In the manga, he is currently dating Miu."
Honjou, Ren;Ren Honjou (本城 蓮);Ren  Honjou;"
Blast's former bassist, Ren is actually Trapnest's guitarist. He is very popular and his music is well-received by fans. He and Nana Osaki were once in a relationship. Ren is a big fan of the Sex Pistols; he participated in a tribute album to them, and wears a ""Sid Vicious"" padlock around his neck that he received from Nana. Nana had an image of a lotus tattooed on her upper arm in honor of him (""Ren"" is a Japanese name for lotus). The brand of the cigarettes he originally smoked was the 'Seven Stars'.

Nana first met him through Nobu, who really just admired him from afar. Ren was popular around their hometown for supposedly being found as a baby in an abandoned warehouse, which he lives in to this day. He isn't ashamed of this; he actually brags about it.

Ren and Nana are proven to be very similar throughout the series, but they are not totally similar. Ren seems to be more open with his love for Nana, being able to ask for her back and her hand in marriage while those thoughts just made Nana want to yell at him. Ren also really would like a family and child, while Nana really dislikes the concept because she doesn't want to be the dependent wife who makes miso soup for her husband all day.


Later on in the series, Ren develops a drug addiction and his life starts to spiral out of control. Shortly after begging his manager for more drugs, on his knees, quivering in pain from withdrawal, he dies. He dies from a car crash. Reporters were following him and happened to see it. While driving, Ren sees a black cat, and thinking it is Nana (due to the hallucinogenics ), swerves into a building, which happened to be where he's lived all of his life in. No one is really sure if it was a suicide attempt or accidental. Crashing into that building does make it seem like a suicide attempt, but his body was found with both of his hands covering his chest and unscathed, which the doctors in the manga say it indicates Ren tried to protect his hands when he realized the car went out of control, thus an accident. Takumi also believes that the incident was not suicidal after seeing his body, because Ren protected his precious music playing hands. Ren's face was unidentifiable due to how severe the accident was."
Ichinose, Takumi;Takumi Ichinose (一ノ瀬巧);Takumi  Ichinose;"

The leader and bassist of Trapnest. He is handsome and has a reputation of being a playboy. Despite his raw sexual charisma, Takumi can also be a cold and controlling workaholic. His favorite brand of cigarettes is Gitanes.


Coming from a family with an alcoholic and bitter father, he and his older sister learned to be independent at a young age due to their mother being bed-ridden with illness in the hospital. He looked after Layla since they were children and always harbored a brother-like care for her. He ends up dating and sleeping with Hachi, which dubiously resulted in Hachi's pregnancy. For some reason, perhaps because of his family background or because he is starting to become possessive, he refuses to leave Hachi and the unborn child despite Hachi's uncertainty whether it is his or Nobu's. In a previous chapter, Naoki said something to Yasu about Takumi not letting the woman he is infatuated with run away that easily; and Ren saying that Takumi hates getting into such mess, which hints that Takumi took responsibility not just only because of sheer sense of responsibility but he is starting to care for her. But although he loves Hachi and is ""infatuated"" with her, Takumi still keeps his playboy habits, cheating on her first with a soap-opera actress and later on with Reira, who has openly declared her desire to become his lover.

In the last few chapters, it is revealed that Takumi and Hachi have another child, whom they named after Ren. Both Takumi and Hachi live separately as the manga ends, due to Takumi's hectic work. Ren, their son, lives with Takumi in England, while Satsuki stays with Hachi, who decides to not follow her husband in order to wait for the missing Nana."
Serizawa, Layla;Layla Serizawa (芹澤レイラ);"Layla ""Reira"" Serizawa";"
Birthdate: November 1, 1978

Although her name is often transliterated as ""Reira"", her actual name is ""Layla"", after Eric Clapton's famous song of the same name. She is half-American, half-Japanese, and is the lead singer of Trapnest. She also penned some of their songs.

Layla's friendship with her band comes all the way back to her elementary school days, starting with Takumi Ichinose. The two met when Layla and her mother moved to Japan. Often criticized by the neighborhood because of her then-vague understanding of the Japanese language, Takumi was asked to befriend her. The two stuck together throughout their childhood, mostly teaching each other about their first language - Reira learned more about Japanese, while Takumi learned more about English.

Layla always showed an interest in singing at a young age, seen through her rendition of Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"". During one of the first times she's shown singing this, she tells Takumi she loves him and gives a rather unexpected kiss. As this prompts him to be (not unexpectedly) put-off, Layla explains, though not very convincingly, that she often kissed (or was kissed by) anyone she respected or admired back in America, such as her parents or teacher. After being told that it's usually only reserved for ""adults in love"", Takumi reluctantly tells her it's fine if she does that, or holds hands with him, as long as it's only when they are alone.

Their friendship remains a close one until the beginning of middle/junior high school, when Layla (again) kisses him after he calls her cute, just like any other day. This time, however, he admits to her that they're getting older and she should only do those things with a boyfriend. Layla doesn't hesitate to ask him to take that place, but Takumi, somewhat unwittingly, rejects her coldly, saying he already has a girl of his own. Takumi begins to tell Layla it shouldn't be hard for her to find a nice boy herself, but by then she's gone from the room.

In between junior high and high school, she befriends both Naoki Fujieda and Yasushi Takagi, the latter of which was then in the band Brute with Ren Honjo. Layla became frustrated with Takumi only seeing their relationship as that of a brother and sister, or in her eyes, being nothing more than Takumi's ""caged songbird"". At one point in time, she even asks him what she is to him, but he doesn't respond. To deal with her unrequited feelings, she begins to date Yasu. Their relationship doesn't last, but it was a nice distraction from the pain.

Within Trapnest, she has at times been seen 'expressing' interest in both Takumi and Ren, drawing the ire of Nana Osaki. To make matters worse, the tabloid magazine, SEARCH mailed to Nana photographs of Ren and Layla together, though the shots were simply of an innocent trip the two took to their hometown. To stop the magazine from publishing the photos, Takumi decided to reveal his relationship with Hachi, who initially was suspicious of Layla as well.

Around the time when her band was at its most popular, Layla decided to visit a nightclub in an attempt to pick up an escort for the night. In doing this, she meets and provokes the attention of Shinichi Okazaki, Blast's bassist. After spending a night with him, she continues their meetings. The two eventually decide (at first through Layla's wishes) that the relationship is more than that of a prostitute and client, and Shin requests she no longer pays him to stay the night.

Eventually, Takumi catches onto their situation. Knowing that the teen was underage, and also that Layla could possibly ruin her career, Takumi warned both parties to think of the possible consequences. Layla initially brushed off his idea, later realizing how potentially dangerous their meetings were, thanks to the media's recent capture of Layla and Ren together. She reluctantly breaks it off with Shin, only to regret it and beg for forgiveness, possibly repairing their relationship. Shin, however, still a bit scared of Takumi's warning and not wanting to sully her reputation, refused. The two have yet to get back together.

In current chapters, Layla has given valentines chocolates to Takumi and tells him she is ""tired of forcing herself"" through tears. Takumi states that she is more important to him than anyone, and inquiries whether she's sure that she only wants to become one of his many lovers, knowing that they couldn't have a relationship. She accepts and they kiss passionately, but are soon interrupted. Takumi flees the scene quickly, but not without catching the eye of Ren, who wanders back into the room to check on Layla. They are last seen walking out together, Layla wiping her eyes. Takumi however becomes unsettled about Layla and himself, and its unclear if their relationship continues in the future."

Miyazono, Kaori;Kaori Miyazono (宮園 かをり);"Kaori ""Kao-chan"" Miyazono";"
Age: 14-15
Birthday: July 4

Kaori Miyazono is one of the main protagonists of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. She is a violinist who helps Kousei Arima return to the piano world after his mother's death.

Kaori Miyazono is a free-spirited violinist whose playing style reflects on her personality. She is independent, unpredictable, and short-tempered. It is also touched upon that she is passive aggressive at times. Kaori likes to depend on herself and only herself and can be seen as more of a support for others.

While considered a really sloppy violin player from a technical standpoint, such as not following music score sheets the way they are written, Kaori is an amazing violinist. Noted by one of the judges at Towa Hall during the first competition of the series, her pure abilities far exceed the others in the competition. She wields a free spirited style of performance that emphasizes emotions and artistry over the pure mechanics of music, such playing to specific tempos and dynamics originally intended by the composer. Her style of music is what rekindles Kousei's passion for the piano and inspires him to redefine himself as a musician.

In addition, she has the ability to play the melodica and has had some experience playing the piano.


When Kaori was five-years-old, her piano class went to see a music recital, there, she first saw Kousei. From the moment he touched the keys and started playing, she was immediately inspired by the spirit in his music. Kaori was originally an aspiring pianist herself, however later decided that she would become a violinist and have Kousei play with her. Kaori was always a physically weak child, and underwent many surgeries. Over time, her hospitalisations became more frequent and prolonged. One day, she saw her parents crying in the hospital as they realized she didn't have a lot of time left. Because of this, she decided to live a full and happy life before passing away. She put on the contacts which she never had the courage to wear, ate a lot and ignored the aspect of her appearance and played the music the way she wanted to and not how everyone else wanted her to. Then, she told a lie.

It is later revealed that she wasn't able to perform with Kousei after she fell and hit her head at home, resulting in her bleeding and passing out. After this incident, Kousei rushed to visit Kaori after hearing from Tsubaki that she was hospitalised again. It later comes to a point where it becomes obvious her health is deteriorating rapidly and she can no longer hide her illness from her friends. She is shown at one stage that her illness has caused bouts of paralysis in her legs, where she suddenly falls to the ground while walking down the hallway in the hospital, unable to make herself stand up. As Kaori's final days were coming, she wrote a farewell letter to Kousei. On February 18, the day of Kousei's piano competition, Kaori had her operation. At her funeral, her mother gave the letter she wrote to Kousei.

After witnessing Kousei performing at the recital, she was awestruck by him and immediately gave up on playing the piano as she wants Kousei to play for her. A few years later, Kaori finally got to meet with Kousei. After getting to know each other, they both realised that they as musicians, have a lot in common. Kaori first found out that Kousei became tone-deaf when he's concentrating on playing the piano when she asked him to play 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' in a cafe. She then demanded Kousei to be her accompanist. Although reluctant at first, Kousei finally accepted when Kaori begged him to support her in that ""moment that she's about to lose heart."" Their relationship gradually strengthens and they start spending more and more time together, especially in the music room. Kousei found himself falling in love with Kaori, but held back because she was Watari's love interest. At the end of the series after Kaori's death, it is revealed that she always had a crush on Kousei and always loved him since she was young, and because she knew Tsubaki also loved Kousei and would never introduce her to him if she found out, thus having to lie about her faked crush on Watari just so she could approach Kousei.

Arima, Kousei;Kousei Arima (有馬 公生);"Kousei ""Friend A, Human Metronome"" Arima";"
Age: 14-15
Birthday: March 28

Kousei is a prodigy pianist and was the youngest pianist to win the Saki Competition but quit playing after the death of his mother resulted in his inability to hear the sounds of his own playing. Following the death of his mother, he lived two years without playing the piano and saw the world through monotone colors, but this changed after meeting Kaori Miyazono, a beautiful young musician who pushed Kousei to his limits in an attempt to get his fingers back onto the piano keys.


As a child, Kousei was obedient and calm. Due to his fear of his mother, Tsubaki was the only one to convince him to tag along in her adventures. Despite being afraid of her, Kousei loved his mother and played freely for her during a competition which angered her. Until later in the story, there are still traces of his mother's verbal and physical abuse that linger in his psyche. Whenever he thought about his piano days, a darkened image of his sick mother would often appear similar to that of a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) attack. His last performance following the death of his mother traumatized him to the extent of leaving him unable to hear himself play. Despite being unable to play piano, music was omnipresent in his life as he would spend his lunch breaks composing. Despite having friends like Watari and Tsubaki, Kousei spends most of his day alone in his thoughts. This dense characteristic makes him a little oblivious to what is going on around him. For instance, he does not notice the resentment his fellow piano competitors had for him nor Tsubaki's crush on him. He also stares at Kaori for long, awkward periods thinking how great of a person she is which she misinterprets as him having perverted thoughts of her. Kousei admires Kaori because she is his opposite; he wishes to become more free-spirited like her. The closer Kousei and Kaori get, the more his feelings for her deepen and the more he opens up to other people. She helps him build his confidence and convinces him to perform again.

Kousei became a piano player at the request of his mother's friend, Hiroko Seto, after Kousei perfectly recreated an improvised song that Hiroko was playing in frustration towards her husband. This led to his mother becoming his piano mentor and teaching him how to play. Following a collapse in his mother's health, Kousei's style of learning to play the piano was drastically changed, as his mother began beating him until he could perfectly play a song based on how it was written in the score. As a result, Kousei started becoming distant from his friends and focused solely on perfecting his piano skills in an attempt to satisfy his mother and make her happy. Kousei was then entered into a number of competitions, in which he stunned the audience with his perfect playing and attained the title ""The Human Metronome"" and was often referred to as his mother's puppet due to Kousei's lack of free will and emotion. Following a winning performance at the Saiki Competition, Saki attacked Kousei and drew blood, causing an outrage amongst competition attendees, but mostly between Saki, Kousei, and Hiroko, with Kousei lashing out at his mother and stating how he wishes that she ""would just die. Coincidentally, Saki passes away a few days later, with the two not having spoken at all between these events. Kousei, feeling guilty about his last words towards his mother and also missing her tremendously, gradually becomes tone deaf during a competition a few days later, breaking down and later hiding in a corner of a room in the concert hall to cry, with only the comfort given from Hiroko. He later gives up being a pianist due to his tone deafness.

Tsubaki is Kousei's childhood friend. She has always gone to his performances and cheered him on. Tsubaki would often invite Kousei to play outside but due to his practice time with his mother, she usually ended in failure. Being with Kousei for a long time, Tsubaki gradually took on the role as an ""older sister."" Kousei was that ""useless little brother she just had to take care of."" Rather than the music type, Tsubaki was the athletic type. She was on the softball team in both middle school and high school along with her senpai from middle school where she enjoyed the sport a lot.

Ryota is a bit of a play-boy. He seems to prefer girls who are ""cute"" seen as he comments in episode 1 that when he sees Kaori for the first time he stated that Tsubaki did a good job on finding a cute looking girl.

It was shown that prior to the storyline, Emi and Takeshi are sitting together complaining about the ""emotionless"" Kousei Arima after losing to him in a piano competition. The rest of the crowd points out that Takeshi and Emi are head and shoulders above the rest of the competition, which makes Kousei all the more invincible for beating the two. While Takeshi sees Kousei as a rival that pushes him to greater heights, Emi has a different motive. She was originally inspired by Kousei's passion and pure innocence during his first performance, she decided to learn piano under Yuriko Ochiai for the sake of expression. Over the course of the story, Emi seeks to oppose the ""boring"" playing style of the old Kousei in hopes to find the ""true"" Kousei once again.

Daughter of Hiroko Seto, Koharu is generally a happy and cheerful child who adores her mother. Koharu has been shown to be quite shy and hesitant around others when she first meets them, but eventually warms up to them and begins to consider them as her family, as seen when she drew a picture of Nagi Aiza playing the piano with Kousei Arima.

Aiza, Nagi;Nagi Aiza (相座 凪 / 藍里 凪);"Nagi ""Nagi Aizato"" Aiza";"
Nagi is Kousei Arima's first apprentice and student. She is a first year student, studying a music course in Kurumigaoka Junior High School. She initially introduced herself as Hiroko Seto's fan, but her ulterior motives were revealed later on.

Nagi is stubborn and childish. She was introduced as a cunning character who despises Arima Kousei.

Nagi maintains a realistic look in life and repeatedly testifies her hate for cliché. Because of her unerring piano skills, she is slightly arrogant and claims herself as ""Angel of Kurumi Junior High"". Nagi also appears to have a distaste for anyone who refers to their superiors without the appropriate honorific, as shown when Miike did not refer to Kousei Arima as his Sensei or Senpai, instead addressing him directly as ""Arima.""

Nagi is often seen to have a brother-complex, seeming to be completely fixated on her brother Takeshi. This complex has driven her to follow in his footsteps in order to get him to notice her and to also stop her brother's own fixation on Kousei.


In the later parts of the anime, Nagi warms up to Kousei, comforting and trying to make him smile while he was upset. Nagi holds deep respect for Kousei and admires him for his piano playing skills. Though it is not stated if she holds affection for him.

Nagi already has exceptional skills in piano before she became Kousei's apprentice. She is the prize winner of the Elena International Music Contest and Obtained the grand prize at the Matsuno Music Contest. When Seto-san asked her to demonstrate her skill, she easily performed Etude Op. 25 No. 5, the same piece Kousei played at the Maihou Competition. During her lessons with Kousei, she blames her small hands for not being able to play in the right tempo or dynamic. Her skills improves drastically after being tutored by Kousei and can even keep up with his playing during her school festival performance. Unlike most musicians in the story, Nagi doesn't perform for 'glory or perfection' but for obligation to become closer to her brother.


When she was younger, she saw her elder brother as some sort of hero. They often played together and had a close relationship, but Takeshi started to fix on Kousei Arima. Because of that, he started to practice hard and the strong bond between the two became thinner over the years. In order to be closer to her brother, Nagi starts to play the piano herself and enters a music Middle School

Takeshi has a very honest and straightforward personality. He is very upfront about his rivalry and hatred (at first) for Kousei Arima. This hatred is later revealed to be an admiration of Takeshi, and how he looked up to Kousei as a hero. Takeshi looks up to Kousei to the extent of rebuking Kousei when he did not meet his expectations as a pianist.

Takeshi is one of the best piano players of his generation, as mentioned for being invited to Europe for competitions and winning the majority of recent piano competitions in Japan.

It was shown that prior to the storyline, Takeshi and Emi Igawa are sitting together complaining about the ""emotionless"" Kousei after losing to him in a piano competition. The rest of the crowd points out that Takeshi and Emi are head and shoulders above the rest of the competition, which makes Kousei all the more invincible for beating the two.

Beatrice;Beatrice  (ベアトリーチェ);"Beatrice ""Golden Witch, Beatrice the Golden, Endless Witch, Beato, Riiche"" ";"
The Golden Witch and Endless Witch, and arguably the primary antagonist of the series. She is affectionately referred to as ""Beato."" She first appears in the ""Tea Party"" of Legend of the Golden Witch, where she confronts Battler over his refusal to accept that his friends and family were killed by magic, and challenges him to a game in which he must prove otherwise from Turn of the Golden Witch onward.

A witch who has lived for over a thousand years, she is said to appear as a cloud of golden butterflies, and has the power to summon higher demons among the seventy-two pillars to serve her. It is said that humans can summon her to have their wishes granted in exchange for compensation, though she often acts whimsically. She is the one rumored to have given Kinzo ten tons of gold and served under him as the alchemic advisor to the Ushiromiya family. There are also rumors of a woman named Beatrice who was kept by Kinzo as a mistress in a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima called Kuwadorian until her death in the year 1967."
Ushiromiya, Battler;Battler Ushiromiya (右代宮 戦人);"Battler ""Endless Sorcerer"" Ushiromiya";"
Birthdate: 15th July
Horoscope: Cancer

Battler is the eighteen-year-old son of Rudolf and his first wife Asumu, and is generally considered to be the main protagonist of the series. He is extremely stubborn, and is afraid of ""shaky"" transportation, fearing he might fall off a boat. At first glance, he appears to be hotheaded, cocky, and even a little perverted (given the fact that he tries to grope young ladies and even his cousin Jessica several times). However, he has a heart of gold he isn't afraid to show when the situation calls for it.

Battler is also an extremely rational young man, and has an extreme talent for deductive reasoning and thinking outside the box, described as ""flipping the chessboard"" so that he may be able to predict the moves and motives of his opponents. Because of this, he does not believe in witches or magic. This causes some conflict with his cousin Maria, who has immersed herself in studies of the occult and believes strongly in witches, especially the Golden Witch Beatrice.


Six years prior to the start of the series, his mother died and his father remarried almost immediately. Battler had a falling out with his father, disturbed by how fast everything went, and rebelled against him, cutting all ties to the Ushiromiya family to live with his maternal grandparents for the next six years. After his grandparents died, he returned to his old home. His relatives held no ill will towards Battler for running away, save for Kinzo; in fact, Battler was able to rekindle his old relationships very quickly. However, out of fear of how Kinzo would react if it was brought up, reference to his rebellion is taboo. The incident six years ago, however, had also caused a different tragedy altogether. Six years prior, Battler confessed to Shannon that he will take her away from the island and save her. However, due to his falling out, he never returned, leaving the stricken Shannon to live her life in hope of something that will never come. This incident had caused the pain of the Shannon personality to transfer deep into Yasu's heart, and because of that, the witch Beatrice was born. Ironically, despite his disbelief in magic and witches, Battler has very strong magical powers. He can generate a barrier that offers him great resistance to anything magical in nature, which serves as the main contributing factor to his denial. As such, he serves as a natural enemy to Beatrice and other witches, since they draw power from those who believe in it. Battler's resistance is thus put to the test by Beatrice, who bombards his sense of logic with countless scenarios that seemingly can't be explained by human means in the hopes that he will ultimately surrender his position and accept her existence. He has in fact neared a breaking point many times, but barely manages to regain his composure and strengthen his magical defenses each time, now to the point where his barrier is nigh indestructible, a perfect shield perhaps not even gods can ever hope to penetrate. Soon after Beatrice's death in the fifth game, Battler is banished from the Game Board after he fails to provide a counter to Erika's theory on the culprit's identity. It is in this pitiful state and limbo where Battler finally solves the mysteries of Rokkenjima and reaches the center of all truths. He returns to Game Board immediately after, and with the help of Beatrice's furniture, he successfully forms his own theory and destroys Erika's. Battler is than named the ""Endless & Golden Sorcerer"" by Lambdadelta and gains all of Beatrice's power as well as the position of Game Master for the sixth game against Bernkastel. His weapon of choice during debates is a golden longsword that allows him to weave with red and strike with blue. His knowledge of the truth even lets him wield a third, known as the golden truth.

In EP8's ""Magic End"", it turns out that he actuallly is still alive, survived from the explosion in Rokkenjima at 1986, but lost his memory due to some circumstances. Because of that, he lived with Hachijo Ikuko and receives a new name, Hachijo Toya."

Famous quote: ""
When they're alive, you can enjoy watching them struggle. When they're dead, you can enjoy tearing out their guts. Tales are things you get to enjoy twice.
""

She is also known as the Witch of Miracles, and greatly resembles Rika Furude from Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. Her name also suggests some connection to Rika's ""alter-ego"" Frederica Bernkastel (which is hinted when Bernkastel quotes herself saying Rika's trademark ""Ni~pa"" sound). It is said she resides in a world where concepts such as fate and probability can be visualized. Despite this, she has a pretty twisted personality and described herself as the ""cruelest witch in the world.""

Unlike other witches she has lifeless eyes. She appears to see Beatrice's game to solve her boredom, and unable to stand seeing the player getting tortured by Beatrice's game, she assists the player by giving some hints around the workings of the game. Her ""Magic of Miracles"" allows her to reset a desperate situation as long as the probability of a favorable situation is not equal to zero (Similar to Hanyuu's power to reset time).

She wants to defeat Beatrice, regardless of the means used for this objective. Throughout Umineko no Naku Koro ni, she maintains an icy and aloof calm in most situations, though by the end of Alliance of the Golden Witch and throughout Umineko no Naku Koro ni Chiru, she is shown to be just as impish and playfully cruel as Lambdadelta.


Frederica is an omni-present being surrounding the Higurashi universe. She is the writer of the poem about Rika's struggle to escape the fate of June 1983, giving hints about each arc. She likes playing with time and events, as seen in puzzle piece #52 and the end of the second season of the anime, entering an alternate world and stopping Miyoko's (Miyo Takano's) parents from dying. She even has an intention of making a world where Rika's or Satoko's parents did not die, or pairing Keiichi with various girls. Although she claims that she is not Rika, it's implied that she is the collective mentality of the several thousand reincarnations of Rika. The pronunciation of Frederica roughly resembles Furude Rika, and Bernkastel is well known for its wine. Plus Rika says herself in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei ""I'll have to stop being the witch Bernkastel,"" after getting confused with dreams, it can be assumed that this choice separates Bernkastel and Rika and makes Rika fully human. This can also be seen as a prove that they're the same person/Bernkastel's origin are Rika's memories. She is also voiced by the same seiyuu as Rika Furude, further enforcing the theory."

The main antagonist and self-proclaimed intellectual rapist of End of the Golden Witch and Dawn of the Golden Witch. She is a young detective introduced in End of the Golden Witch. A blue-haired girl estimated by Genji to be about Jessica's age, 18, she's highly intelligent and possesses a photographic memory.

She's quite polite in public and shows a deep interest in mysteries. In reality, she's quite ruthless and cunning and only solves mysteries, so she can sneer at those who pose them. She does, however, possess a serious inferiority complex, since she emotionally breaks down whenever things aren't in her favor.

Rudolf and Kyrie's six-year-old daughter, and Battler's sister. She could not come to the island in 1986 due to a sickness.

Like her brother, she has a habit of saying, ""It's useless, it's all useless"" during difficult situations.


After the events of Banquet of the Golden Witch, she is raised by Eva after she returns alive from Rokkenjima, and studies to become the next family head. However, she is put through many hardships, particularly due to Eva's belief that her son George should have been the next head; their relationship even worsens even though Eva gets a genuine desire to raise Ange as if she were her own daughter, due to Bernkastel manipulating a young Ange into rejecting Eva as a surrogate mother. Before her death in 1998, Eva passes down the gold and the title of the Ushiromiya family head down to Ange. Ange decides to try her luck and see if she is really supposed to be alive even after her entire family is dead by jumping off a skyscraper, knowing that there is a construction going on several floors down and that she might land on a safety net. She survives and decides to figure out the truth of Rokkenjima in the year 1986. At the end of Alliance of the Golden Witch, the witch version of Ange is violently torn apart when she reveals her true identity to Battler; however, her human self survives and continues to investigate the true circumstances involving Rokkenjima."

Famous quote: ""
Both love and happiness are the same as the air. Even though it fills the world, if you don't understand it, it's the same as if it doesn't exist.
""

She is also known as the Most Powerful Witch in the Universe before losing to Bernkastel and is feared by most other witches, including Beatrice. She is quite childish and holds a grudge against Bernkastel for finally beating her in their last game, although she actually cares for her.

Her ""Magic of Certainty"" allows her to kill anyone without fail as an absolute result, which bends the basic rule of Umineko magic requiring a risk. Like Bernkastel, she is a Voyager. She wishes for Battler and Beatrice to fight against each other for eternity as a part of a larger plot to have Bernkastel lose against her.

She has lived for a thousand years. As a witch, she embodies the concept that 'hard-workers are rewarded', and is very respected even by human beings. She doesn't flee from the human concept of witch. Hence, the power of hers, who is a being respected by human beings, is immeasurable. However, she is whimsical about whose efforts she will reward and, in many situations, the person who can please her more will be able to receive her smile.

Her tremendous and swiftly fierce power makes any kind of witch surrender in a moment. However, she seems to be reckless and it was thoroughly read by Bernkastel.


Her name and appearance hint at her being connected to Miyo Takano from Higurashi leading to the possibility that the ""game"" she played with Bernkastel was the world of Higurashi with the battle between Rika and Takano being the purpose of the game. ""Lambdadelta"" (λδ) represents thirty-four when using Greek numerals and ""Miyo"" (三四) can be translated as ""three, four"" in Japanese, strengthening their connection."
Ushiromiya, Maria;Maria Ushiromiya (右代宮 真里亞);"Maria ""Witch of Origins"" Ushiromiya";"
Maria is Rosa's daughter, and is the youngest of the cousins at nine years old. She has a habit of uttering 'uu-uu' at times, which frustrates Rosa greatly. Maria is also rather stubborn, and believes things easily, which isn't uncommon for someone her age. She has an interest in the occult, like her grandfather. She carries around a bag which is filled with occult items, such as a scorpion charm which wards off evil. She idolizes witches, and believes that they are there to bring people joy and happiness. In Maria's notebooks there are sketches of witches, and the witches are beautiful, fantastical creatures. It upsets Maria greatly when someone denies the existence of witches, especially Beatrice's existence. At certain times, Maria undergoes a personality change, and begins to laugh in an unnerving fashion. When she is in this mode, she acts rather condescendingly with regards to things about the occult, and will often call people like Battler 'stupid' for having little to no knowledge of such things.


She is the subject of bullying in her class, and the boys in her class often took her books and rubbed them off each other, saying that they got her 'germs'. However, Maria is content with being bullied. Maria came up with quite an imaginative story, where a horrid witch is terrorizing the school, causing students to get into accidents and the like. However, an angel offers one student as a sacrifice so that all the other students shall be safe. With that story, Maria doesn't mind being the subject of bullying, as she feels like everyone else can remain safe while she shoulders the burden. Although she has no real friends, with Maria's vivid imagination, she breathes life into her stuffed animals. Namely, Sakutaro. Sakutaro was originally a stuffed lion cub, created by Rosa as a birthday present to give to Maria. Maria cherished it, and even though she was often alone, with Sakutaro she didn't feel as alone. However, Sakutaro met a tragic end when Rosa ripped him apart. Maria is a rather innocent child, and fully believes that her mother needs to work such long hours and weekends. Rosa often forgets Maria's promises, but Maria says that her mother's work is more important. Rosa has told Maria never to call her work office unless it's an emergency. But, once when Maria called, the office told her that her mother wasn't at work. Even when Rosa takes impromptu holidays with her various boyfriends, Maria fully believes in her mother. Rosa often gives in to guilt, and ends up buying Maria presents, such as 'the rabbit band', or various Western sweets. Maria as a witch In the Umineko series it is heavily debated whether magic exists or not, but Maria has her own personal grimoire, in which she conjures up her own spells. Such as, 'have [x] for dinner', or 'make mama come home early'. One particular spell is for her mother's love, where all that is required is a simple 'uu-uu'. Maria came up with this spell after a rather touching day spent with Rosa on a picnic. Rosa taught Maria a song, and Rosa was so pleased that Maria knew the words. However, when Maria forgot the words, she started singing 'uu-uu' instead, but Rosa remained in her happy state. While Rosa thought that her saying 'uu-uu' was charming for a while, she eventually grew frustrated with it, and often resorted to hitting her. Whenever Rosa hits Maria, Maria says that she has been taken over by 'the black witch'. Maria is a member of the Mariage Sorcière, an alliance of witches in which she and her idol, Beatrice, are exclusive members of. Despite having the same wand as Eva-Beatrice, she is not an Endless Witch successor. By succeeding to give a soul to Sakutaro, she is a potential Creator: a witch with an even higher rank than Bernkastel and Lambdadelta, who (when she will learn how to use her power) may be able to create even a galaxy from nothing. She is also the witch teacher of Ange, despite the fact that they did not see each other as she was banished from Mariage Sorcière."
Kanon;Kanon  (嘉音);"Kanon ""Yoshiya"" ";"
A young servant of Kinzo's mansion. His real name is Yoshiya (嘉哉?). He is a serious and fervent servant, carrying out his master's orders thoroughly. He is a bit frail and antisocial. He considers Shannon as an older sister and highly disapproves of her feelings for George, as he believes she should not feel love as she is only furniture. He has feelings for Jessica, which he tries to hide from even himself, because he thinks of himself as ""furniture"", rather than a human being. However, it is shown that he still deeply wishes to become a human being, and hopes to do so when he reaches the Golden Land. In Dawn Of the Golden Witch, he confesses to Jessica and they become a couple. He is willing to do whatever he can so he can be with Jessica as a human and be worthy of her love. Based on what Beatrice has shown Battler, he is able to use a red blade of light in battle and link with Shannon. Despite seeing himself to be in despair, he actually has surprisingly good relations with others on the island.


Kanon is actually one of the personalities of Sayo Yasuda, who is the child of Kinzo and Beatrice Ushiromiya. ""Kanon"" is the embodiment of the Yasu's teenage repressed self, as well as her masculine side. Started his existence when Yasu became suspicious of her body condition."

Dlanor is Chief Inquisitor of Eiserne Jungfrau and a first-class archbishop, popularly known as ""Dlanor of the Ten Wedges"" and ""Death Sentence Dlanor"". She is named after Ronald Knox, and even upholds Knox's Decalogue during her debates. She has the appearance of a young girl with lavender hair and yellow eyes, and wears a uniform similar to that of a cleric. The ends of her sentences are written in katakana as a form of honorific. She is cold towards witches and takes her duties very seriously. Despite her duties as a witch-hunter, however, she is old friends with Virgilia (she classifies Virgilia as one of the ""good witches"").

Her main weapons are her Red Key and Blue Key, which take the forms of a longsword and shortsword, respectively. She is only dispatched by the Great Court as a last resort after a case is vigorously inspected; in other words, to have Dlanor sent is the equivalent of receiving a death sentence, hence the nickname ""Death Sentence Dlanor"". Her father created Knox's Decalogue and was a legendary Inquisitor, but broke his own commandments and was interrogated and executed by Dlanor herself, who stopped aging physically and mentally afterward for mysterious reasons.

She first appears in Banquet of the Golden Witch, where she helps Eva solve the riddle of Beatrice's epitaph, leading to her discovery of Kinzo's hidden gold and her inheritance of the Ushiromiya family. As stipulated in the epitaph, Eva inherits the name ""Beatrice"" and is granted the titles of Golden and Endless Witch, with Lambdadelta as her guardian. Eva-Beatrice is described by Ange as a ""black witch,"" meaning she manipulates others through anger and hatred. In many ways, she is even crueler than the original Beatrice, using her Endless Magic to ""play"" with her victims by killing them in bizarre ways (drowning in a sea of jelly, crushing under a mountain of cake) before resurrecting them and killing them again, repeating the cycle until she tires.

She is most likely the manifestation of all the Eva culprit theories similar to how Black Battler is the manifestation of all the Battler Culprit theories.

Yang Wenli is a commodore, currently serving in the 2nd fleet of the Free Planets Alliance.

The son of a merchant and a pacifist at heart, Yang never wanted to be a soldier; his dream was to become a historian, but he didn't have the money to pay for his tuition and joined the army to get a scholarship. He barely made it through the officer's academy due to his lack of interest, though he did make a number of friends there including Dusty Attenborough and Jean Robert Lap. He also met music student Jessica Edwards and both him and Lap developed a crush on her, Jessica eventually chose Lap, Yang accepted her decision and they remained friends.

Soon after he graduated, Yang became involved in a battle near the friendly planet El Facil, because of his superiors' incompetence and cowardice, the planet was abandoned while a hostile imperial fleet was on its way. Yang was one of the few officers that remained behind and tried to help the population, thanks to his efforts the planet was evacuated in time. Because of this achievement he became famous as ""the hero of El Facil"" and ""miracle Yang,"" forever earning the envy of his peers and the scorn of his superiors.

It was at El Facil that Yang first became interested in tactics, but ever since that incident and although he kept rising through the ranks, his novel tactical suggestions were being arbitrarily rejected by hostile superiors. Though disappointed and increasingly cynical with the state of affairs in the Alliance, Yang never stopped trying to do at least the absolute minimum to justify his salary and the pension he was so looking forward to.

Miracle Yang, also called ""the magician,"" is a genius tactician, as well as a competent strategist. Unlike his often proud adversaries, Yang is more than willing to resort to trickery and his only flaw as a commander lies with his inability to go against the orders of his superiors. Yang holds democracy in an extremely high esteem and has a well-defined political philosophy, providing much insight to anyone willing to listen to him. In his personal life he appears to be quite slothful, he is notoriously incompetent with house chores, as well as in all things romantic. After serving on the Patorokolos in the start of the series, Yang eventually gets the battleship Hyperion as he his given command of the 13th fleet, and this becomes his flagship during the coming conflic­ts."
von Lohengramm, Reinhard;Reinhard von Lohengramm (ラインハルト・フォン・ローエングラム);"Reinhard ""von Müsel, Golden Lion, Golden Brat, Blonde Brat, Kinpatsu no Kozou"" von Lohengramm";"
Birthdate: March 14, 467 R.C. (776 U.C.)

Count Reinhard von Lohengramm is a young admiral in the Galactic Empire.

He was born Reinhard von Müsel to an impoverished aristocratic family. His mother died when he was very young and he only has faint memories of her. His father's will was shattered at about the same time and the only person left to care for young Reinhard was his beloved older sister Annerose. When Reinhard was about ten years old, his family had to move into a middle class suburban neighborhood. There he met Siegfried Kircheis who would become his best and perhaps only friend, but whatever happiness Reinhard managed to find as a child was to be short-lived.

The emperor Friedrich IV took a liking to his sister and ordered her to move into his palace and become his new concubine. Afraid that if she refused she would bring down the emperor's wrath on her younger brother, Annerose reluctantly accepted and her father even managed to get some money out of it. Infuriated Reinhard swore vengeance against the emperor, vengeance against the Goldenbaum dynasty and vengeance against the oppressive nobility. He swore that he would never rest until he freed his sister of her predicament and became powerful enough never to be ordered by anyone again.

To achieve his goals and with Kircheis by his side, Reinhard joined the military. He quickly rose through the ranks and after proving his ability time and again to the hostile and corrupt nobility, ever reluctant to accept a fallen aristocrat like him into their ranks, he became an imperial high admiral and was elevated to peerage as the ""count of Lohengramm"". As he steps into the admiralty, the Emperor gives him the prototype battleship Brünhild, which serves as Reinhards flagship from then on.

Nicknamed ""Blonde Brat"" by his enemies and ""Golden Lion"" by his friends, Reinhard is a handsome and gifted individual, a superb tactician and an unequaled strategist. Brave and noble, he always leads his fleets from the front, much to the admiration, as well as the horror, of his subordinates. Ambitious and determined, Reinhard is only hindered by his immeasurable pride, his warlike nature and the turmoil in his heart."
von Reuenthal, Oskar;Oskar von Reuenthal (オスカー・フォン・ロイエンタール);"Oskar ""Bewitching Eyes"" von Reuenthal";"
Birthdate: October 26, 458 R.C. (767 U.C.)

Oskar von Reuenthal is a rear admiral serving in Reinhard's fleet and, along with Wolfgang Mittermeyer, Reinhard's ablest field commander.

Reuenthal was born to a lowly, but rich noble father and a mother from a distinguished but impoverished line that only married his father for his material affluence. Reuenthal was born with a rare condition called heterochromia, one of his eyes is blue, while the other is brown. Since both his parents had blue eyes, this was seen as proof of his mother's adultery. His mother committed suicide after trying to pluck out his brown eye while he was still an infant. Reuenthal's father put the blame on him and he grew up hated and neglected.

Reuenthal joined the military and rose through the ranks rather quickly, finding in war the reason he needed to keep on living. While stationed in fortress Iserlohn, he met Wolfgang Mittermeyer and the two became close friends. Mittermeyer is probably the only person Reuenthal has managed to have a normal relationship with and he greatly values their friendship. When Mittermeyer was unjustly detained and in danger of assassination by the nobility, Reuenthal didn't hesitate to pledge his loyalty to Reinhard in return for his help with Mittermeyer's case.

Reuenthal appears calm and composed on the outside, he is a brilliant war strategist, second only to Reinhard, and an accomplished tactician, but Reuenthal is, in reality, a ticking bomb ready to go off at any moment and perhaps would have already exploded if not for Mittermeyer's soothing presence in his life. His problematic childhood has ridden him with an incredible amount of self-loathing and a complete inability to trust women, though handsome and successful with the opposite sex, he never manages to get into a healthy relationship. Proud and ambitious Reuenthal often contemplates treachery, but his respect towards Reinhard and the debt he owes him, manage to restrain him. His flagship is the Tristan."
von Oberstein, Paul;Paul von Oberstein (パウル・フォン・オーベルシュタイン);Paul  von Oberstein;"
Paul von Oberstein is a captain serving as chief of staff in fortress Iserlohn of the Galactic Empire. He was born blind and has to wear artificial eyes to see. He has nothing but contempt for his incompetent commander and despises the high nobles, realizing fully well the decadence of the Goldenbaum dynasty and how ignorant they are of the common people's plight. If he himself had been born a few years earlier, when the ""inferior genes exclusion law"" was still in effect, he would have been discarded as dangerous to the species. Because of that and realizing Reinhard's abilities, he wants to join his camp.

Oberstein is a genius strategist and organizer, both in war and politics. Calm and composed, he never shows any sign of emotional distress, everything he says and does is part of a well thought, reasonable plan."
Kircheis, Siegfried;Siegfried Kircheis (ジークフリード・キルヒアイス);Siegfried  Kircheis;"
Birth date: January 14, 467 R.C. (776 U.C.)

Siegfried Kircheis is a young captain serving in Reinhard's fleet, as well as his best friend.

Born a commoner, Kircheis first met the future Reinhard von Lohengramm when they both were about ten years old. Reinhard's family had just moved in the house next door, after introducing themselves to each other, Reinhard declared that Siegfried was a very common name and from then on he would call him Kircheis which sounded better, the two immediately stroke up a friendship that was to last for life.

When the emperor took Reinhard's sister to be his concubine, Annerose asked Kircheis, who had an innocent crush on her, to promise that he will always be by her brother's side. Kircheis kept his promise, he followed Reinhard in the military and together they rose through the ranks facing many trials, eventually Reinhard was made a count and was awarded the command of a fleet, opening their road to power.

Kircheis is an excellent tactician, often able to discern and even predict Reinhard's elaborate battle plans. A kind person and a dedicated friend to Reinhard, he is always by his side, and goes on the fight alongside him in his red colored battleship Barbarossa. He often acts as a restraint for Reinhard's ambition as well as his wrath when his arrogance gets the better of him. He believes both in Reinhard's abilities and the righteousness of his intentions and his only goal is to help Reinhard fulfill his destiny."
Mittermeyer, Wolfgang;Wolfgang Mittermeyer (ウォルフガング・ミッターマイヤー);"Wolfgang ""Gale Wolf"" Mittermeyer";"
Wolfgang Mittermeyer is a rear admiral serving in Reinhard's fleet and, along with Oskar von Reuenthal, Reinhard's ablest field commander.

Mittermeyer is a commoner, born to a middle-class family. He first met Reuenthal while stationed in fortress Iserlohn, early in his career, and the two became close friends. Kind and caring, Mittermeyer has been a stabilizing factor for Reuenthal's self-destructive tendencies ever since. A family man at heart Mittermeyer soon married his childhood sweetheart Evangeline and became a dedicated husband, but their efforts to have children have been fruitless thus far. Unfortunately for him, his lowly pedigree was about to cause him serious trouble.

Mittermeyer ordered the execution of one of his subordinates for assaulting, robbing and murdering a civilian woman. Although his decision was just, he turned out to belong to a powerful noble family and Mittermeyer was soon arrested. While the nobles plotted his death, desperate to save his only friend Reuenthal met with Reinhard von Müsel (later Lohengramm) and offered his and Mittermeyer's loyalty to him, in exchange for aid in saving Mittermeyer from the nobility and clearing his name. Reinhard, who had his own well-known issues with the nobles, readily accepted and both of them were transferred under his command.

Nicknamed ""the gale wolf,"" Mittermeyer is renowned for his boldness in warfare, his lightning responses to changing factors in the battlefield, as well as his ability to cover huge distances in a relatively short time, while keeping his fleet organized from his flagship Beowulf. Under Reinhard's command, he receives the flagship Beowulf. Mittermeyer is an able strategist and a brilliant tactician, one of the very best of his era. He is composed, just with his subordinates and fiercely loyal to Reinhard, not only for saving his life, but also because he honestly respects his abilities."

Minci, Julian;Julian Minci (ユリアン・ミンツ);Julian  Minci;"
Birthdate: March 26, 782 U.C.

Julian Minci is the son of a soldier who served in the Alliance's army, he lost his mother at a very young age and, some years later, his father was killed in battle leaving him a war-orphan. As such Julian was admitted in the wartime welfare program and, through the mediation of vice admiral Alex Cazellnu, he was made Yang Wenli's ward.

Julian is a very intelligent and responsible boy with a knack for house chores and is the one who takes care of the domestically incompetent Yang, so much so that their friends often wonder who amongst the two is the real guardian and who the ward. Julian loves Yang and deeply respects him, both for his kindness and his well-defined philosophy on life.

Yang wants a peaceful life for Julian, but, much to his disappointment, Julian's dream is to follow in his and his father's footsteps and become a soldier."
von Mariendorf, Hildegard;Hildegard von Mariendorf (ヒルデガルド・フォン・マリーンドルフ);"Hildegard ""Hilda"" von Mariendorf";"
Birthdate: 468 R.C. (777 U.C.)

Hildegard von Mariendorf is one of the principal characters in the series. She served as the New Galactic Fleet's Chief Advisor
She later reigned with Reinhard von Lohengramm when she became his wife and Empress in U.C. 801.

Hildegard, usually referred to by the nickname Hilda, was born in Galactic year 777 into an distinguished noble family of the Goldenbaum dynasty, the sole daughter of the benevolent and just Count Franz von Mariendorf. From an early age, she was distinguished from the other girls of the aristocrat society by her independent ideas. Completely unconcerned, Hilda pursued her own interests in reading, politics and history. Her mother having died when Hilda was young, her open-minded father respected Hilda's unique ideas and choices in life.

In U.C. 797, the old galactic empire spilt into civil war, where the old nobility stood against the new emerging camp of military elites lead by Reinhard von Lohengramm. Hilda convinced her father to plea allegiance to the latter, whereupon she met Reinhard for the first time and impressed him with the clarity of her insight. When the Lohengramm camp emerged victorious from the civil war, Reinhard gained complete political and military power in the empire, and Hilda became Reinhard's chief secretary and assisted him in the progressive reforms that swept across the empire.

From U.C. 798 to U.C. 800, Hilda played an active role on the galactic stage, advising Reinhard wisely on imperial policies and tactics, and became one of his most valued and trusted staff. During Operation Ragnarök, where the empire battled the Alliance, Hilda served as a staff officer and became the first female to board the Flagship Brünhild.
During the critical battle of Vermillion, she perceived that the situation was in Reinhard's disfavour, and persuaded Generals Mittermeyer and Reuentahl to mobilize forces against the Alliance capital, turning the war to Reinhard's tactical victory and saving his life. General Mittermeyer later praised Hilda that ""her intelligence is worth more than a fleet."" Her role gradually became more public after Reinhard's coronation as the first Emperor of the new Lohengramm Dynasty. In the year U.C. 800, in the Ninth Battle of Iserlohn, Hilda succeeded General Steinmetz to become the Fleet's Chief Advisor, formally capable of representing the Emperor and command on his behalf on the battlefield. Conscious of her military position, Hilda withheld her political role and refused to advise Reinhard on political matters, despite his repeated requests for her counsel. In August of U.C. 800, Reinhard was attacked by an assassin who sought vengeance for Reinhard's inaction in the Westland tragedy. Overcame with regret and emotional agony, Reinhard withdrew into his own quarters and Hilda entered to console him. Subconsciously realizing that his reliance on her has deepened past their professional relationship, he asked her to stay, and she agreed, determined to help him to the best of her abilities. The morning after, Reinhard came to Hilda's home and proposed marriage, and Hilda did not immediately reply for the uncertainty whether she can truly give him happiness. She also did not reveal her pregnancy to him until after the Urvashi affair and Reuentahl's subsequent rebellion, which deepened the insight of both Hilda and Reinhard toward their own feelings. When peace was restored, Hilda accepted Reinhard's second proposal, and they were married on January 19, U.C. 801. The officials of the empire greeted their new Empress with enthusiasm and joy. On May the 14th, while Reinhard was away at war, Hilda give birth to a son, whom Reinhard named Alexander Siegfried von Lohengramm. Reinhard's illness seriously exacerbated a mere sixteen days later and was diagnosed with a rare form mutative connective tissue disease, with no know cure. Despite the illness, Reinhard decided to return to the imperial capital for the sake of the people awaiting him there. On July the 18th, Reinhard and Hilda were re-united. On July the 26th, the dying Reinhard said his final words to Hilda: ""My Empress, you shall rule the universe more wisely than I. If you think setting up a constitution is the better way then so be it. The universe would be fine as long as the strongest and wisest among all the living governs it. If Alexander Seigfried lacks that ability, there is no need for Lohengramm dynasty to continue. Do everything as you wish; that is my greatest wish..."" He died at the age of twenty-five, with their son succeeding him and Hilda ruling as the Empress dowager. She was remembered by later historians as the person who nurtured the Lohengramm Empire to maturity."

Himura, Kenshin;Kenshin Himura (緋村 剣心);"Kenshin ""Hitokiri Battousai, Himura Battousai, Shinta, Ken-san"" Himura";"
Age: 28
Birthday: June 20, 1849
Height: 158 cm
Weight: 48 kg

Kenshin Himura, also known throughout the anime as Hitokiri Battousai (Battousai the Manslayer) or Himura the Battousai is the main character of the anime series Rurouni Kenshin. His original name was Shinta (心太). His parents died of cholera when he was very young and as a result, was adopted by three slave women in a traveling slave wagon. Soon after meeting them, bandits had raided the convoy and killed his three new guardians and were about to kill him when a man named Seijuro Hiko killed the bandits. Hiko soon adopted the child and because Shinta was not a name fitted for a swordman, he renamed him Kenshin, meaning ""Heart of Sword,"" took him under his wing and taught him the Hiten Mitsuruugi Ryu.


However, before full completion of the sword style could be passed on to Kenshin, the Japanese Revolution had been happening at the time and right before Kenshin's eyes. Because of his kind nature and seeing people suffering, he knew he needed to do something about it. He left in the middle of his training and without his master's blessing and joined the Imperialists. It was during the Revolution where Kenshin met Tomoe, his first love and wife. (See Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal OVAs). During the revolution, Kenshin was given the nickname of Hitokiri Battousai because of his god-like speed of drawing a sword to kill the enemy instantly. After helping the Imperialist to a position where they would undoubtedly win the revolution, Kenshin left the revolution all-together with a vow to never kill again and the reverse-blade sword handed to him by Shakku-dono. It was Tomoe's death by his hands that pushed him over the edge of never to kill again.
The next time Kenshin is seen is 10 years later as he has become a wanderer who helps out anyone in need who is suffering right before his eyes. Those long 10 years have taken him from Kyoto, all over Japan to where we find him in episode one of the anime, in Tokyo, still keeping his vow never to kill again. It is here where he meets Kaoru Kamiya and his whole life begins to change once again. (See Rurouni Kenshin anime).

Kenshin is usually depicted as a care-free swordsman who is very aloof and tends to be a bit simple-minded when it comes to living normally. He is seen to be doing many of the chores around the dojo that he stays at with Kaoru, (i.e., cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc.). He believes it is his way of repaying Kaoru with allowing him to stay at her dojo. (although it seems he has gotten attracted to kaoru in the end).

However, his swordsmanship ranks among the elite as he is seen defeating every rival (with the exception of Hajime Saitou which ended in a draw). His battle senses are top-notch and he recognizes even the slightest of advantages, strategies and tactics during a sword battle.

Sagara, Sanosuke;Sanosuke Sagara (相楽佐之助);"Sanosuke ""Sano, Zanza, Rooster Head, Street Fighter"" Sagara";"
Age: 19

Sagara Sanosuke left home at an early age to join the Sekihō Army (Sekihō-tai), leaving behind his father (Kamishimoemon), his mother (Naname), and his younger sister (Uki) who adored him. He would return home years later to discover that his mother was dead, having died a couple of years after the birth of his younger brother, Ota, who immediately began to admire Sanosuke for his bravery and boldness. Sanosuke would also find out that his family name was now Higashidani, although he would never use it himself. His sister, after Sanosuke's disappearance and then her mother's death, became overprotective of her younger brother and father, who worked as a local merchant and farmer with the infamy of being a local fighter. Ota, after Sanosuke leaves his family again, would eventually follow his brother's advice and train at the Kamiya Kasshin-Ryū style dojo to become strong.

The Sekihoutai fought for the imperial alliance at the end of the Tokugawa regime and Sanosuke admired his captain, Sagara Sōzō and took the family name Sagara from him. The Sekihō Army were on assignment to spread word of the halving of taxes proclaimed by the revolution. However, when the revolutionary government encountered financial problems, they labeled the Sekihoutai as frauds to bury their promises. This setup was engineered by Shindō Tatewaki, a former officer in the imperial alliance. The Sekihoutai were designated scapegoats and to be executed; Sanosuke was the only survivor, other than his friend Tsukioka Katsuhiro. The exact circumstances of Sōzō's death differ between the animated version and the manga; in the manga Sanosuke realized he had been killed after seeing his decapitated head on display as a warning, while in the anime a wounded Sōzō pushed Sanosuke to safety off a cliff in order to save him before dying himself.

Full of anger and bitterness, Sanosuke made a living as a fighter-for-hire who bore the nickname ""Zanza"" derived from his weapon, the zanbatō. Sanosuke's sword, the heaviest katana ever made in the Rurouni Kenshin universe, originates from the Ōnin Struggle. Due to wear the blade no longer has an edge. Sanosuke uses the sword to smash and crush.

Hiruma Kihei and Gohei hire Sanosuke to kill Himura Kenshin, but after the former assassin defeats Sanosuke and Sanosuke learns of the truth of Kenshin's no-kill approach, Sanosuke becomes a valuable ally. He later adopts a boxing-like fighting skill, known for the strength of his right fist. Because the zanbatō broke during the fight, Sanosuke no longer wields it on a regular basis, using only one more time in the manga to defend the Kamiya dojo during the Jinchu arc.

At the end of the manga series, Sanosuke leaves Japan to avoid becoming wrongfully arrested and travels the world. He is not heard from until five years later during a reunion of the Kenshin-gumi, in which he tells them via a letter that he is in Mongolia and will stay there for a while before heading back to Japan.

The primary instructor of the Kamiya Kasshinryuu fighting style developed by her late father, Kamiya Koshijirou, Kaoru inherited a small dojo from her father after he was killed during the Seinan War and operates it by herself.

Yahiko is a samurai descendant. Yahiko's father died during the Battle of Ueno during the Boshin War, slain at the Keneiji Temple. His mother died of syphilis in a brothel to put food on their table not long after giving birth to her son. Yahiko was originally forced to live as a thief for the local Yakuza, who tricked him into believing that he still had to pay off the money the gangsters gave to his mother to buy medicine. With the help of Himura Kenshin and Kamiya Kaoru, he becomes an apprentice of the Kamiya Kasshin-Ryuu style.

Yahiko has a friend/rival, Tsukayama Yutarou and a sweetheart, Sanjou Tsubame, who works at Akabeko."
Saitou, Hajime;Hajime Saitou (斎藤 一);"Hajime ""Gorou Fujita"" Saitou";"
Hajime Saitou is loosely based on the real third-squad captain of the Shinsengumi. During the Meiji era, he lived as a police officer under the name of Gorou Fujita. In the Rurouni Kenshin series, he plays the role of Kenshin's old rival and enemy from the Bakumatsu. He has no compassion or mercy for his enemies and he lives by the Shinsengumi code ""Aku Soku Zan (悪即斬),"" literally ""Slay Evil Immediately,"" but more poetically rendered as ""Swift Death To Evil."" His signature technique is the Gatotsu, a left-handed thrust and a variation of the Hirazuki technique developed by Toshizou Hijikata, the Vice Commander of the Shinsengumi. Although the Gatotsu is a fictional technique only found within the Rurouni Kenshin series, the Hirazuki is a real technique that was used by many of the Shinsengumi members."
Seta, Soujirou;Soujirou Seta (瀬田 宗次郎);"Soujirou ""Tenken, Sou-kun, The Prodigy"" Seta";"
Seta Soujirou is Shishiou Makoto's right hand man, a teenage assassin trained by Shishio himself. Soujiro is known for his lack of kenki or, simply, emotion. He possesses no anger and cites no fear in his enemies, other than with his sword.

Soujirou is often seen smiling and has polite manners, always referring to others with Japanese suffixes. He is sarcastic, hiding his true emotions behind his smiling face. He however does have a special relationship with Yumi, she being a sister figure towards him. Soujirou usually dresses up in a blue kimono with white handguards

Soujiro's constantly smiling face and polite manners stem from his tragic past. Born in Kanagawa Prefecture during the first year of Bunkyuu (1861), Soujiro is an illegitimate child. Sōujiro's father left him in the care of his family, who badly mistreat him. He is assigned chores such as carrying rice to and from the family warehouse, and whenever he faltered, he was beaten by his family. Soujiro built a defense against their lashings; he put on a smiling face, and endured the torture until they got tired of beating him and left him alone.

One night, he meets Shishio, who was on the run from the police. Soujiro witnesses Shishio kill some police officers and Shishio is about to kill him for it until he notices Soujiro smiling and therefore spares him in exchange for food and bandages. Shishio tells Soujiro that only the strong may live and that his predicament is his own fault for being weak. This new mentality, and a sword given to him by Shishio, determine his defence when his family finds him housing Shishio. Sojiro quickly finds himself cornered by them, attempting to murder him and blame his death on Shishio, and lashes out, killing every one of them at the age of eight.

Soujiro''s apparent lack of emotion, his simple, insensitive mentality that the strong will live and the weak shall die, and his skills make him a formidable foe for Kenshin. As a master swordsman of his own style, Soujirou's abilities have earned him the nickname of ""Heaven's Sword"" (天剣, Tenken?, Ten meaning Heaven and Ken meaning Sword, ""Tenken"" means swordsmanship of natural endowments). His shukuchi utilizes such powerful speed that, to an observer, it appears that the distance between the two fighters has shrunk (hence the name shukuchi, which means ""reduced earth"").

During his fight with Kenshin, Soujiro continually states he's only moving ""three steps below shukuchi"" or ""two steps below shukuchi."" While moving at the speed his shukuchi utilizes, the only thing that can be seen is Soujiro's footsteps ripping through the tatami mats. During ""one step below shukuchi"", he is able to attack from an omni-directional angle, utilizing not only horizontal but vertical space While performing true shukuchi, he completely disappears and cannot be seen, even by Kenshin. Soujirou can dodge the Kuzu-ryūsen (九頭龍閃?, lit. ""Nine-headed Dragon Flash""), a move which apparently cannot be evaded even by Kenshin himself. Soujirou is also the first one ever to slash Kenshin in the back in the series.

Soujiro is also well versed in the Battōjutsu style like Kenshin, as is evident when he decides to use a stance similar to Kenshin's and when he destroys Kenshin's first sakabatō. Combining the true speed of shukuchi with the Battōjutsu, he has created his only named technique, Shuntensatsu (瞬天殺?, lit. ""Instant Heaven Kill""), meaning ""immediate killing by heaven's sword"". It is named this because the speed behind the attack is so swift that the opponent dies instantly before falling to the floor.

Shishio, Makoto;Makoto Shishio (志々雄真実);Makoto  Shishio;"
After the death of Yukishiro Tomoe, Himura Kenshin became a free wielding swordsman to protect members of the Ishin Shishi. Shishio Makoto became his successor as the shadow hitokiri (assassin) and was responsible for the assassination of Izuka, the man who had betrayed the shishi.

The future Meiji government was more secretive about Shishio than Kenshin; many members of the Chōshū and Satsuma clans (the members of the future Meiji government) would have very little information on him.

Later, the new Meiji government believed it would be in their best interests to eliminate Shishio before he became too powerful since Shishio was a man who desired power. Thus during the Boshin War, Shishio was rendered unconscious by several gunshots, doused in oil and burned alive by the new government formed by the Ishin Shishi. He survived, sustaining severe damage to his entire body. Afterwards, he assembled a group of the best fighters in Japan, called the Juppongatana (Ten Swords), to overthrow the Meiji government.

Shishio envisioned a Japan ruled by him, enforcing the principles of natural selection, or what he called ""the strong eat the weak"". Using this belief he ran a campaign against the Meiji government, as he felt it was too weak to effectively lead the country. Using his motto, he molded an ideological disciple out of Seta Sōjirō, who served as his right-hand man, and the strongest of the Juppongatana. He planned to strengthen the economy with petroleum once he took over the country."
Hiko, Seijuurou;Seijuurou Hiko (比古 清十郎);"Seijuurou ""Niitsu Kakunoshin"" Hiko";"
The thirteenth successor to the sword art of Hiten Mitsurugi-Ryuu, Hiko Seijuurou saved young Shinta from marauding bandits who killed his companions. Hiko then took care of Shinta, and renamed him Kenshin (""Heart of Sword"") after claiming that Shinta was not a good name for a swordsman. He became angry and disappointed with Kenshin, because he ran away to join the rebellion against the Tokugawa regime. He shut himself away from the rest of the world; he lives as a potter close to the forest near Kyoto. In Seisouhen/Reflection, he also realizes that the Hiten Mitsurugi-Ryuu no longer seems relevant in the changing world, as he remarks to Yahiko: ""The only thing that doesn't seem to change is the moon.""

Hiko is perhaps the strongest swordsman around; he is far superior even to Kenshin. Although the two are comparable in speed, Hiko possesses a superior sense of judgement in combat and the superhuman strength (hidden, and even suppressed, underneath his heavy cloak) to wield Hiten Mitsurugi Ryuu to its maximum. After fifteen years, master and student meet once more. It is then that Kenshin will complete his training, if Kenshin can survive Hiko's ego.

The cloak is not only distinctive for all Hiten Mitsurugi masters, but it also serves to strengthen them in peacetime. Even when conflict is not at the door, Hiko remains in training just by wearing it, as it is composed of several heavy materials that weigh him down and force him to work out because of counter-springs with pressure of around 37.5 kilograms. Watsuki mentions in the manga that he based the billowy capes' image on Spawn of Image Comics by Todd McFarlane (the size of the collar pieces was reduced in the anime).

The name Hiko Seijuro is in fact a title granted to each succeeding master of Hiten Mitsurugi-Ryuu. Since Hiko Seijuurou II, each new master has discarded his own name in favor of the name of the creator of Hiten Mitsurugi-Ryuu. As Kenshin declines to take the name ""Hiko Seijuurou XIV"", his master is the last man ever to be known as Hiko Seijuurou."
Shinomori, Aoshi;Aoshi Shinomori (四乃森 蒼紫);Aoshi  Shinomori;"
Shinomori Aoshi was raised a ninja of the Oniwabanshū, who worked for the Shogunate government during the Edo period. He helped to raise Makimachi Misao from childhood as a member of the Oniwabanshū.

After the revolution, since a few members of the Oniwabanshū were unable to adapt to life in the Meiji era, Aoshi and these members worked for the corrupt, power-hungry business man, Takeda Kanryū instead. Aoshi's subordinates included Beshimi, who specialized in darts and poison; Hyotoko, whose name literally means ""Fire Man"" and uses flint-and-steel teeth to breathe fire; Han'nya, a skilled martial artist, deft ninjutsu practitioner and Aoshi's student; and Shikijou, a ""muscle man.""

Aoshi himself remains an enigma. He rarely (if ever) shows emotions in or out of a battle. His weapon in the beginning of the series involved only one kodachi (in combination with martial arts). However, after his defeat at Himura Kenshin's hands at Kanryu's mansion, he dedicated himself fully to revenge for the sake of his fallen comrades. When Aoshi next appears, he uses double-kodachi, and seems to have fully disregarded his emotions in order to kill Himura.

They fight at Shishio Makoto's mansion in order to settle the score, and upon the battle's break, Aoshi realizes where he went wrong, and becomes somewhat of an ally."
Yukishiro, Tomoe;Tomoe Yukishiro (雪代 巴);Tomoe  Yukishiro;"
Yukishiro Tomoe was the eldest daughter of a samurai, a low-level bureaucrat who served the Tokugawa Shogunate in Edo. Her only sibling was her younger brother Enishi, who viewed her as a surrogate parent because of their mother's death shortly after his birth.
As required by the Shogunate, she practiced Buddhism. She kept diaries to record her inner thoughts and emotions, which she found difficult to express more openly.


This reticence left Kiyosato unaware of how much she truly loved him. Thinking that he needed to please her with greater accomplishments, he went to Kyoto to join the Mimawarigumi and was killed by the Ishin Shishi assassin, Hitokiri Battōsai (Himura Kenshin), but also gave the Hitokiri a single slash scar along the face. Tomoe had met Kenshin shortly after the killing, and went undercover for some time, pretending not to know that Kenshin was the man who had killed her fiance. As a result of the suspicion, she and Kenshin left Kyoto and married, hiding in wait while Tomoe planned Kenshin' death. When the time came for Tomoe to reveal her secrets and kill Kenshin, she had already realized that she had fallen for him, and to save his life, she gave away hers, etching the second scar across his cheek so he would never forget her love.

Eye color: deep teal (1999), royal blue (2011)
Blood type: A
Occupation: ex-assassin, hunter
Nen type: Transmutation

Killua is a member of the Zoldyck family, who are a family of legendary assassins. Since birth, he trained endlessly in the art of assassination. He eventually ran away from his family and profession out of boredom and joined the Hunter exam to pass the time. He befriended Gon almost immediately and has loyally followed his best friend since then.

Killua is usually a kind-hearted and cheerful, cheeky boy, but if provoked, he becomes extremely deadly and bloodthirsty, able to kill an enemy in seconds.

He is confident and aware of his abilities and strengths, and not afraid to speak his mind, but also smart enough to know when to hold his tongue. He can get embarrassed easily when someone compliments him or openly shows affection towards him.

He is very intelligent and quick-thinking, and skilled in analysis, particularly induction. He is able to calmly and rapidly form strategies to adapt to stressful situations.

Due to his training as an assassin, it's an ingrained habit of his to be extremely cautious when approaching a fight, often assuming the worst case scenario, so he is quicker to flee than to try to face an apparently stronger opponent. For most of the series, this is his greatest flaw. He is also a loyal friend who is selfless to a fault, and suffers greatly trying to help his friends without a single thought to his own health.

He is also from the transmutation Nen group. He constantly strives to improve his Nen ability, developing many interesting techniques as time moves on.

He is also the third person to have a transmutation Nen as his father and grandfather also are transmutation Nen users. Coincidentally, all three family members have silver hair."

Gon's an innocent boy who is willing to help anyone, especially his friends. He rarely ever looks at anything in a bad way. His curious and naive personality often frustrates his friends but this is also the reason why many people are attracted to him. He is also from the enhancer nen group.

Nen type: Conjuration; Specialization (when his eyes are Scarlet)
Abilities: Holy Chain, Dowsing Chain, Chain Jail, Judgment Chain

Kurapika is a member of the Kurta tribe who were massacred by the Phantom Troupe (The Spiders) 4 years prior the Hunter exam. The Kurta tribe was an isolated group of people whose eyes would turn scarlet when angered or excited. These scarlet eyes were known to be beautiful, being one of the seven most beautiful in the world. Because of this, the Kurta tribe was constantly pursued and eventually massacred. The eyes of the tribe members were all taken away during the massacre. Kurapika is so far the only known survivor with a heart bent on revenge. He strives to have his revenge against the Phantom Troupe as well as recover the eyes of his tribe members.

Despite having a heart full of hatred, Kurapika is very kind and loyal towards his friends. He is an extremely intelligent person but at the same time reckless. Kurapika is from the materialization nen group and from determination, increased the power of his nen ability to the point that it was formidable against the Phantom Troupe.

Kurapika can conjure a unique weapon — five chains that extend from each finger on his right hand. Some of the fingers were specially designed to deal vengeance on the Phantom Troupe. To increase his effectiveness against the formidable Phantom Troupe, Kurapika places strict Limitations on the usage of his chains. The purpose of the chain on Kurapika's index finger has yet to be revealed.

Kurapika's Techniques

Holy Chain (癒す親指の鎖 ホーリーチェーン The Healing Thumb Chain): Type Conjuration and Enhancement
Shaped like a cross, it cures wounds by drawing from Enhancement abilities. When Kurapika is in his Specialist state, its ability is Enhanced and can heal serious injuries within seconds.
Chain Jail (束縛する中指の鎖 チェーンジェイル The Restraining Middle Finger Chain): Type Conjuration, Emission, and Manipulation
Shaped like a hook, it wraps around Spiders and restricts their movement. Also forcefully causes its prisoners to enter Zetsu, shutting off their aura and preventing the use of Nen abilities. Escape from the Chain Jail is only possible through brute force. Kurapika imposed a limitation onto this chain, it can only be used to deal with members of the Phantom Troupe. If this condition is violated, Kurapika will die. This condition was needed in order to increase the strength of the ability.
Dowsing Chain (導く薬指の鎖 ダウジングチェーン The Guiding Ring Finger Chain): Type Conjuration
Shaped like a ball and chain, Kurapika uses this frequently under normal situations, for defensive and offensive purposes. It is also useful for other investigative activities, like determining the location of missing individuals. He also uses this chain to identify if someone is lying. It has a small ball-like weight at the end which moves in the direction of whatever he is dowsing for.
Judgment Chain (律する小指の鎖 ジャッジメントチェーン The Arbiter Little Finger Chain): Type Conjuration, Emission, and Manipulation
​The Stake of Retribution, a blade on the end of the Judgment Chain, enters the victim's body and wraps around the heart. Kurapika sets two conditions and if the victim violates either one, the chain crushes the heart, killing them. It can only be used while Kurapika's eyes are scarlet. Kurapika himself has a blade wrapped around his heart, which he used to set the conditions of use for his Chain Jail ability.
Emperor Time (絶対時間 エンペラータイム Absolute Mastery): Type Specialization
When Kurapika's eyes shift into scarlet, he changes from a Conjurer to a Specialist. This ability allows him to utilize all the types of Nen to 100% efficiency (for a Conjurer). In the manga, Kurapika explains this using the terms ""Level"" and ""Force/Accuracy"". Kurapika's ""Levels"" in the various Nen categories remain the same during Emperor Time, however, his Force and Accuracy for every category is raised to 100%. Thus, if Kurapika's Level in Conjuration were 10, his Level in Emission (the polar opposite aura type) would be 4, and during Emperor Time, he would be evenly matched against a Level 4 Emitter at 100%. Outside of Emperor Time, his Force and Accuracy in Emission would at most be only be 40%."

Notorious for his cruel and deceitful fighting ability, Hisoka has proven to be deadly. His deviousness and volatility has made many opponents have difficulty anticipating his next move, and this has led to him winning many battles. Using Shu powered poker cards as his primary weapon, he throws them with ease and deadly accuracy.

Also, he is very intrigued by Gon and the potential this young boy has to become an adept and powerful adversary. Hisoka, ever looking for a strong opponent, is willing to aid, or at least not defeat prematurely, someone that could develop into a future opponent.


During the Yorknew City arc, Hisoka is revealed to have recently replaced the fourth member of the Phantom Troupe, though his association with the organization is, rather characteristically, based on his drive to fight remarkable opponents. His main goal was to fight their leader, Chrollo, but his membership proved to be a farce, because he would never appear without other Troupe members, and rarely at that. This information is divulged in secret to Kurapika.

Meruem;Meruem  (メルエム);"Meruem ""The King, The Chimera Ant King"" ";"
The chimera ant King, Meruem is the most powerful offspring of the chimera ant Queen.


Meruem is first seen when he violently rips through the womb of the chimera ant Queen from the inside, ready to emerge into the world and unwilling to wait for a natural birth. Shortly after his birth, Meruem leaves the hive and NGL with the Royal Guards, in search of a place to start his kingdom. He descends on the Republic of East Gorteau and takes over over the country by killing its dictator, Ming Jol-ik. Meruem then uses Jol-ik's corpse as a puppet to order East Gorteau's population of approximately five million to gather simultaneously in the capital city for a national rally. This however, is a ruse, designed to create a situation where entire towns and villages could be secretly abducted for a ""selection"", the forcible awakening of nen, without their disappearance being noticed. Meruem's eventual plan was to take the one percent of the population that would survive such an awakening and turn them into soldiers for an army he will use to conquer the world. This plan is temporarily disrupted by Killua, who assassinates a number of ""selectors"", but a backup plan is soon implemented; East Gorteau is put under martial law, and the population undergo selection in their own homes, though this slows down the process considerably, and only 500,000 people are processed, with 5,000 predicted survivors. Soon after this occurs, the Hunters Netero, Morau, Knuckle, Shoot, Killua, and Gon attack the palace, with the intention of separating the Royal Guards from Meruem and assassinating him. Meruem's initial personality, when he his first shown in the story, is that of arrogance. The Queen's intention to give birth to a perfect offspring is reflected in Meruem's mentality. He considered himself superior to all other forms of life and felt no concern for his dying mother after his ""birth."" Meruem was also merciless, instantly killing any chimera ant he considered disrespectful. Meruem was seen killing and eating other chimera ants, something no other chimera ant had ever done. After reaching East Gorteau and putting his plans into motion, Meruem took an interest in various board games, and gathered various champion-level players to his palace. Simply by reading the rule books, Meruem was able to master any game in under ten matches, simultaneously learning from his opponents while disrupting the ""flow"" of their play style. After defeating the best player for each game, Meruem proceeded to kill them, as they were of no further use to him. The final game Meruem learns is Gungi, a fictional shogi-like board game invented by East Gorteau. The world champion for the game is Komugi, a seemingly dimwitted blind girl; However, as Meruem played against her, he found himself unable to disrupt her flow, while at the same time, the challenge of playing against Meruem caused Komugi's skills to increase. Much to the shock of the Royal Guards, Meruem even starts show respect for Komugi and concern for Komugi's well being. In one instance Meruem rips his left arm off, as an apology to Komugi for asking her to bet her left arm on a game, to which she replied that she always bet her life. In another instance, after watching Komugi's nen suddenly awaken, and realizing she would grow exponentially stronger, but only in terms of Gungi, Meruem momentarily decides that his power of ""violence"" was the strongest type of strength, and ultimately Komugi's abilities are meaningless; Yet, moments after this decision, Meruem finds Komugi under attack by a large bird of prey, and is unable to bring himself to do anything except protect her, ultimately unable to understand his own emotions toward Komugi. This leaves Meruem in a contemplative state, wondering about the purpose for his existence in the world. As of chapter 290 of the manga, Meruem is preparing to battle Netero, who attacked his castle in order to assassinate him. Before the battle, Komugi is gravely injured by a nen ability meant to cause confusion within the palace, and Meruem orders Nefelpitou to save her life. The way Meruem is drawn in this scene suggests he has learned what it means to have concern for someone else's well being. He and Netero then travel to a remote location that was once used for military weapons testing, so that they may both go all out in their fight. However, in a surprising twist, Meruem refuses to fight the Hunter. Through a short conversation between the two, the King reveals that he finally realizes that he should use his power to protect the weak, seeing from Komugi that there are humans who deserve to live; Netero counted among them. He also expresses a desire to remake the world so that everyone is so equal, the term ""equality"" would become obsolete. Netero realizes that Meruem is dangerously caught between his Ant instincts and his humanity, and at this point, either facet of his psyche could win out. Knowing that he has a mission to carry out regardless, and not wanting his heart to waver, Netero suddenly assaults Meruem first with a devastating attack. Meruem possesses a nen ability that allows him to absorb the raw aura of nen-users he has killed. By devouring their brain, he adds their aura to his own--further increasing his power. His fighting ability is such that even Netero, chairman of the Hunter committee, expresses doubt that he could defeat him.

Neferpitou is a cat-humanoid Chimera Ant and the firstborn of the Chimera Ant King's three Royal Guards.

They are very loyal to the King, just like the rest of the Royal Guards and would sacrifice themselves for him. Neferpitou gets distracted easily, loves to play a lot and that makes them the most curious of the three Royal Guards. Hence their cat-like appearance, Pitou is a cat Chimera Ant who loves to play with their opponents like a cat would with their prey. Despite their cheerful and playful manner, Pitou has a sadistic and terrifying personality as well.

Unlike Menthuthuyoupi and Shaiapouf, Neferpitou does not seem to mind much in regards to Meruem's later newfound interests with Komugi. Thus, among the three Royal Guards, Neferpitou is the only one that greatly prioritizes Komugi's safety as opposed to how Menthuthuyoupi and Shaiapouf hate Komugi, something Neferpitou is aware of which creates distrust in regards to the matter, for making their king deviate from the path they envision for him.

None other than the Chairman of the Hunter Committee, and the final authority over the entirety of the Hunter Exam. He has enough administrative power to grant anyone the Hunter's license if he decides to do so, and enough combat power to playfully avoid attacks of the main heroes single-handedly when they challenge him. All examiners, even the most despotic ones, obey his orders without talking back.

He was said to be the strongest Nen user in the world 50 years ago, but he comments that he is already past his prime at his current age and that his subordinates might be stronger than him now (yet his direct subordinates disagree). Netero is also revealed to be older than Zeno Zaoldyeck (Killua's Grandfather), who is said to be 67 years of age. At one point, Zeno says that when he was still a young boy, Netero was not only already old, but he is the only person alive who has fought with Maha (Zeno's) grandfather. Various stated times would put Netero over the three digit mark.He is able to use attacks faster than the speed of sound. His ability is known as 'Hyakushiki Kannon', or the '100-type Guanyin Bodhisattva'. This utilizes nen to make the attacks seem as if they had come from another side and or dimension, simply because they move so fast.


In the Chimera Ant Arc, he is also shown fighting chimera ants and is heading towards the destined fight with the King. His assistants Morau and Novu note that he was the strongest Nen user 50 years ago, and show great respect for his abilities.

A native of Man-Home, Akari is a happy and easy-going person, who we rarely see angry or upset, a quality which she shares with her supervisor. She is best described as a romantic, and seems to find enjoyment in things or events that other people might think humdrum and mundane. Akari often says ""Hohe"" or ""Hahi"", which is her short version of ""wow.""

While she is not quite as skilled in rowing as Alice, nor is as familiar with the history of the city as Aika, her carefree and laid-back manner often endears her to the many people she encounters. As such, she seems to make friends very easily, and can hold a warm conversation even with complete strangers, a fact that causes her to be labeled as 'mysterious' by her closest friends Aika and Alice. She also accidentally learned how to row backwards on the gondola back when she was at Man-Home, which Aika states, ""Akari is almost invincible when she rows backwards"" (from the anime and the manga). She is frequently writing letters about her adventures on Aqua to an unnamed person back on Man-home (revealed in the last chapter of the manga); in the anime, these letters are directed to Ai.


Later, when Akari passed the test for Prima, she is given the title ""Aquamarine"" or ""Harukanaru Ao"" by Alicia meaning distant blue.

A girl introduced in volume 3, Alice is a trainee for Orange Planet, a company who currently holds the first place in the water guide business. She first appears as a very standoffish, snotty young girl; however, exposure to Akari's mood begins to lighten her up as the series progresses. This does not stop her from telling the other girls to be quiet when they argue, however.

She is just a trainee when Akari and Aika are apprentices, but is already showing a talent for rowing that might surpass both of them (in fact, this is the reason why she was scouted by Orange Planet despite her age). Despite this (and the fact that Akari and Aika are from rival businesses), she often joins the two in joint practice sessions, and she sincerely enjoys their company.

Alice speaks in a very deadpan manner, and tends to use the word dekkai (でっかい - meaning ""huge"") often in the course of speaking. Aika also commonly addresses her as ""Kohai-chan"" (後輩ちゃん - or ""junior"" said in a friendly manner).


Of the three girls, Alice is actually the first to become a prima, efficiently sidestepping the single/journeyman status and earning herself the nickname ""Orange Princess"" (as seen above.) Alice not becoming a single might be because she was going to school, and because Orange Planet didn't want to burden her with the addition of potentially being able to take on customers when accompanied by a Prima, as she arguably had the talent to become a single even before she met Akari and Aika. (Since the single test is basically rowing up the canal to the Hill of Hope.

As the only daughter of its owners, she is also Himeya's heir, but does not enjoy the distinction that much, as she feels that she is fawned upon too much by the company's employees.

Aika often speaks in an open and blunt manner, and goes out of her way to cut off Akari's many idealistic comments with a preemptive ""Embarrassing remarks are not allowed!"" (恥ずかしいセリフ禁止！, Hazukashii serifu kinshi!). Despite their contrasting personalities, she gets along quite well with Akari, and later with Alice. She is very proud of her undine abilities, and tends to be very competitive in this aspect. She also worships Alicia, and finds any excuse to go over to Aria company and spend time with her. Aika once said that if it was not for the obligation to her family, she would join Aria company. Aika has feelings for Al.

She is nicknamed the Demon Instructor for her strict training regimen as well as her loud and brusque personality. She is particularly harsh with Aika, in spite of the fact that the girl is her employers' heir, though she does so since she honestly thinks that there is potential in her. As such, she is the only Himeya employee who does not fawn on Aika, though even the latter admits that it is only due to Akira's strictness (and honesty) that she has been able to become a good undine. As a prima undine, she is known as ""Crimson Rose"" (真紅の薔薇).

Akira is famous for her conversational skills as well as her intimate knowledge of the sights to be seen in Neo Venezia. She has a lot of admirers among her customers, though surprisingly enough these are more female than male (which seems to bother her a little, as she considers herself very feminine).

Akira and Alicia's relationship mirrors Akari and Aika's, though Alicia is far more teasing when Akira is around. This isn't that much of a surprise, as Akira and Alicia are childhood friends. However, Akira is still galled that Alicia became a Prima earlier than her, despite the fact that Alicia initially became an undine to tag along with her.

Maa is the smallest of the company cats. She is mostly white with patches of black and brown fur. She has a great affinity for biting President Aria's belly and does so whenever she can much to President Aria's dismay."
