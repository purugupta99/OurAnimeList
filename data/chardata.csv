Edward ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" Elric is a young alchemical prodigy. He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed's primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a ""hero of the people"" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn't seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al's suffering.

Edward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4'11""), however his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. Although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, Ed's ability to fight is not impaired, and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. His heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in Amestris. They were made by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. He is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. These qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter.

Born to Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim of Resembool in the winter of 1899, Edward's first few years were relatively happy; but after the sudden departure of his father during the lad's formative years, Ed was left with his mother and younger brother Alphonse as his only family. The three Elrics lived in peace in the rural village and the boys began displaying a remarkable talent for alchemy at a young age, much to the joyful astonishment of his mother. However, early in the year 1904, Trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. Even while mourning, mired in grief, Edward vowed to his brother that the two of them would find a way to bring their dear mother back to life with the power of alchemy.

Edward and Alphonse spent the next few years living on their own in the Elric family home, supported by their close childhood friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako, and pursuing the alchemical knowledge necessary for their planned resurrection. Although they had gained a great deal of information and comprehension regarding the extended basics of the craft, before long it became apparent to the young prodigies that there was only so far they could go while being self-taught. In a stroke of good fortune, Resembool was visited by an exceptionally skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis who, after some persuasion, agreed to take the Elric brothers on as her apprentices provided they pass a preliminary test. After they do, the Elric brothers were subjected to Izumi's intensive alchemy and martial arts training, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to Resembool.

Though instructed specifically by Izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the ""One is All, All is One"" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics to a forbidden practice called Human Transmutation.

Devising a Human Transmutation Circle, amassing the elemental ingredients for an adult human body and offering their own blood as soul and biological data, the boys secretly initiated the Human Transmutation in their home. Unfortunately, the Human Transmutation resulted in a Rebound.

Alphonse and Edward were pulled into The Gate. Encountering the mysterious being called Truth, Edward was stripped of his left leg in exchange for crossing into God's domain and peeking at the Gate's vast wealth of alchemical knowledge. Maimed and bleeding, Edward was returned to the human dimension to find that Alphonse had not yet returned from his disappearance into the Gate, that the mother they had attempted to revive was a grotesque mass of organs only capable of sustaining life for a few moments and that his own sojourn into the Gate had granted him the curious ability to perform transmutations merely by clapping his hands together, without the aid of a Transmutation Circle - in the same style used by Izumi. Desperate to at least have his brother by his side, Edward willfully performed another Human Transmutation to call him back, this time sacrificing his right arm in exchange for Al's soul, which he bound alchemically to an antique suit of armor with a Blood Rune before passing out from severe blood loss. Alphonse carried Ed to the Rockbell house, where a shocked Pinako and Winry performed emergency surgery to save the young boy's life.

On the night of the failed transmutation. Lt. Colonel Flame alchemist Roy Mustang came to the Rockbell's in response to a letter that Edward and Alphonse had sent him in the mail asking about their Father. He was shocked at the fact that the two boys had tried human alchemy and survived, and informed them that they could become state alchemist and maybe one day find a way to return their bodies to the way they were. Desperate to get His younger brother's body back, Edward asked the Rockbells to give him prosthetic limbs called automail. Though they warned him the surgery would be painful, he said the pain was nothing compared to what his brother had given up. He only took a year to adapt to the automail at age 11 when it took most adults 3 years."

Alphonse Elric is a fictional character in the manga and anime series Fullmetal Alchemist. He is a human child who lost his body during a forbidden alchemical transmutation to bring his deceased mother back to life, and had his soul transmuted into a suit of armor by his brother, Edward Elric. Al's blood seal lies just below the base of the neck at the back of the suit, on the inside. It is drawn with Ed's blood. According to Edward, he needs to be careful whenever he reconstructs Alphonse's body because he must keep the blood seal intact during the transmutation. If the blood seal is removed, Al's soul will be lost.

Mustang, Roy;Roy Mustang (ロイ・マスタング);"Roy ""Flame Alchemist"" Mustang";"
Birthday: 1885 (Age 30 from vol. 10)
Height: 5'8"" (173 cm)

Roy Mustang is the ""Flame Alchemist,"" having absolute control over heat and fire through alchemy. Using special gloves that create a spark when he snaps his fingers, Roy can create anything from a tiny ember to burn a letter, to a raging inferno that can destroy a humanoid body in seconds. His precise control over the alchemically enhanced flame is so accurate that he can boil the water in a persons' eyes and can also attack enemies amongst a riot without hurting any allies.

Outwardly arrogant and playfully manipulative, Mustang is intelligent and almost always one step ahead of his opponents, and likes to feel in control of the situation. He is one of the superiors of Edward Elric. On the surface, he appears to be nothing more than a man of the military who pursues promotions and praise and is considered a ladies' man who constantly goes on dates with different women. Mustang's true goal is to become Führer in order to gain the power to reform the government in order to absolve his sins in the Ishval War as well as change the country for the better, along with the joking requirement for female officers to wear tiny miniskirts (which considerably increased Havoc's loyalty to him and caused Hawkeye to be angry with him).

His goals are admirable enough that he earns the fierce loyalty of his good friends Lt Col. Maes Hughes, Major Alex Louis Armstrong, and his own subordinates, among whom are Riza Hawkeye, Jean Havoc, Heymans Breda, Vato Falman, and Kain Fuery. While Mustang has a close and amicable relationship with all of his subordinates, he appears to share a deeper bond of affection with his second-in-command Riza Hawkeye, who has devoted her life to supporting him. This bond culminates in the final episodes of the anime when Mustang chooses Hawkeye alone to accompany him on his greatest and most dangerous mission.

Though a hero of the Ishval War, he remains haunted by the horrors of war and suffers great remorse for the lives he took.


After the Promised Day arrives, he is forced to open the gate by Pride and Wrath, they first try to make him do it voluntarily by reviving Hawkeye, but he refuses. So Pride opens the gate for him using his Philosopher's Stone. Mustang gains the power to transmute without a circle, however his price is his eyesight.

Hughes, Maes;Maes Hughes (マース･ヒューズ);Maes  Hughes;"
Maes Hughes is a character that is hard not to love. He is often seen as the comedy relief but has his debuts as a serious and skilled fighter. He is best friends with Roy Mustang (and would do anything to help Roy achieve his goals) and a loving and devoted husband/father. Maes would do anything for his wife Gracia and always carries pictures of his daughter Elycia in his uniform and never misses a chance to show everyone how cute she is. He starts out in the anime as a Major in the Investigation Division and eventually becomes a Lieutenant Colonel.


He is killed by Envy upon his discovery of Father's plans, and is posthumously promoted to Brigadier General after his death."
Greed;Greed  (グリード);Greed  ;"
Greed is a greedy Homunculus, nicknamed the ""Ultimate Shield"". He is able to rearrange the carbon in his body to make his skin as hard as diamond, thus making himself almost impossible to injure. As his name implies he is a very avaricious character, who likes living in luxury, surrounded by powerful minions and beautiful women. Despite his generally greedy nature, he is shown to honestly care for his subordinates. He also has a habit of flipping people off in the manga.


In the 2003 anime series
Greed is the second oldest of the Homunculi created by Dante. However, due to his avarice, Greed rebelled and was eventually captured and imprisoned in lab 5. He was imprisoned for 130 years until an explosion broke his seal. He then freed the caged chimera at Lab 5 in exchange for helping him get his revenge on the other homunculi and their master.


In the manga and 2009 anime series
He is the third Homunculus created by Father. Greed apparently abandoned the other Homunculi over 100 years before the start of the series and claims to be around two centuries old. He first appears hiding in the Devil's Nest in Dublith, with his gang of chimeras all of whom he apparently rescued from military experimentation.


After Greed is punished by Father, he later returns as Father removes his son's Philosophers Stone core from his own body and inserts it directly into the body of Ling Yao to create a second Human-based Homunculus. This second Greed maintains all the same personality and powers as the first (his Ouroboros tattoo is even in the same spot), but appears to have none of his previous memories, not recognizing Envy, Gluttony or the Elric Brothers. As such, he becomes a faithful servant of his Father, as the first Greed was presumed to have been initially, and refers to all actions prior to his rebirth as having been done by ""the other Greed"". However, as Greed is a host in Ling Yao's body, Ling is able to regain control of his body if Greed let's his guard down or allows him to. By doing this, Ling is able to regain his sixth sense of detecting another's presence, but is not able to use the Ultimate Shield. Greed is reluctant to willingly give him back his body however. After killing a past comrade and follower of his, memories from Greed's previous life returned, including his time in the Devil's Nest and the feelings he had for his followers. Remembering this, along with how Bradly killed most of his followers, leads Greed to betraying Father once again. He also stops referring to his ""previous self"" as ""the other Greed"" upon regaining his memories. After forming a temporary alliance with Edward and company, Greed and Ling help in the fight against the Homunculi and the Central Troopers. In the afternath, as Edward, Alphonse and the military engage Father, he steps in and allows Father to absorb his Philosopher's Stone, afterwards giving Ling his body back, claiming the only thing he truly wanted were friends. He then reverses his Ultimate Sheild, turning Father into a brittle coal-like substance and fades away with his Father, a smile on his face.

Hawkeye, Riza;Riza Hawkeye (リザ・ホークアイ);Riza  Hawkeye;"
Riza Hawkeye is Roy Mustang's most trusted subordinate. She carries out many of the tasks he is too lazy to do, acts as his personal assistant, and protects him from danger. She also doubles as his voice of reason, keeping cool in heated situations and scolding him when he allows his emotions to get in the way. Riza and Roy seem to share a close relationship in both adaptations of Fullmetal Alchemist; in the anime she identifies him as her most precious person, whereas in the manga she loses her resolve to live when believing he has been killed. Riza specializes in firearms, particularly sniper rifles, and can hit nearly any target with lethal accuracy. She adopts a dog, called Black Hayate in both the anime and the manga, which she raises with stern discipline; when Hayate goes to the bathroom inside, she shoots at the wall behind him to reinforce that doing so is bad."
Armstrong, Alex Louis;Alex Louis Armstrong ;"Alex Louis ""Major, Strong Arm Alchemist"" Armstrong";"
Major Alex Louis Armstrong, the Strong Arm Alchemist, was born into an elite family of alchemists and has mastered his family's techniques. Members of his family have, in the past, filled the highest military and political positions in the state. He acquired his alchemy titles for his skill of using arm strength in his alchemy. All though he may look intimidating, he is really friendly and (overly)affectionate, and often stays behind or risks his life for the safety of others. He also has a tendency to show off techniques passed down to him to his enemies, and make them feel somewhat awkward during a battle.

The scion of the illustrious Armstrong family, Alex is a remarkably caring commander and friend as well as an invaluably skilled ally to Colonel Roy Mustang and Edward Elric."
Yao, Ling;Ling Yao (リン・ヤオ);Ling  Yao;"
Ling Yao is a Xingese character exclusive to the manga and the 2009 anime series. Due to his father, the Emperor's, declining health, Ling left his country to find the Philosopher's Stone to stabilize Xing, as well as grant him the key to immortality. Although he is the 12th son of the Emperor, Ling hopes the Philosopher's Stone will help him rise in the order of succession and achieve the throne thereby securing his clan's welfare. Though he is often laid back and hungry, he's very noble and will do whatever it takes to help his clan. He is also a skilled fighter and has had many incidents involving assassination attempts at his life. He has formed a strong rivalry with Ed, by doing things such as use Ed's money to annoy him.


After the 1st Greed is punished by Father, he gives Ling the secret to immortality by transforming him into the succeeding Greed. Ed tries to help, but Ling denies his help as it is the only way to help his clan in the land of Xing. Even while his body is taken over by Greed his mind and soul are kept intact and can come to the surface. Since Greed understands his strong points their relationship is on some kind of symbiotic level.

After the main events of the series, he is shown to be the new Emperor of Xing; sitting on the throne, with Lan Fan still acting as his bodyguard."
Rockbell, Winry;Winry Rockbell (ウィンリィ・ロックベル);"Winry ""Win"" Rockbell";"
Birthplace:
Resembool

Birth date:
June 9, 1899

Age:
15-16 (Around 18 at the end)

Family:
- Pinako Rockbell (grandmother)
- Urey Rockbell (father, deceased)
- Sara Rockbell (mother, deceased)

Affiliations:
- Rockbell Automail
- Atelier Garfiel

Occupation:
Automail mechanic

Abilities:
Automail specialist and mechanic, amateur surgeon

Unique Trait:
An unusual love for machines and tools

A childhood friend of the central characters, the Elric brothers, she is often seen in their company throughout the series. She is evidently Edward's love interest. Specializing in mechanical repair, specifically with automail, Winry services Edward's arm and leg whenever it is in need of repair or replacement.


In the manga, Winry becomes an apprentice to Garfiel, an automail engineer in Rush Valley. She also studies techniques for making automail for northern frigid conditions. Her parents, both doctors, were killed by Scar during the Ishbal war when she was very young. In chapter 47 at the Central, she tried to shoot Scar after finding out that he was the one who had killed her parents. She frequently travels with the Elrics in earlier chapters and later, returning back to Rush Valley, realizes that she has been in love with Ed for a long time, and Ed has the same feeling though he constantly denies it. It has been mentioned in chapter 15 that Alphonse and Edward had once fought over who would get to marry Winry when they were kids, making Ed freak out and become incredibly flustered, claiming that he didn't remember that. Alphonse won, but was rejected. After Ed asked her why, she replied with ""I don't like guys shorter than me,"" resulting in a huge blow on Ed's ego. Due to her importance in the lives of the Elric brothers, Winry is used as a hostage by the military to gain Edward's obedience. In order to escape from the military possession, she decided to travel with Scar and the others. It was revealed in chapter 73 that it was her plan for Scar to use her as a hostage in order to escape although she has not forgiven him for killing her parents. In chapter 84 Winry is taken on a military train back into Resembool in a water tank. When she goes into her house, she is shocked to find Ed in her room while she is undressing. They both scream which causes everyone to believe that the two of them are in danger. Shortly afterwards (after beating his head a few times), she fills Ed in on where Al is and what have been happening in Lior. Ed tells her to leave the country, but she refuses, wanting to help Ed in any way that she can. Ed soon departs, and Winry stays in Resembool for the time being. At the epilogue, Ed confesses (or maybe more like proposes) to her, and in a photo, it shown that they're married and have two children."
Envy;Envy  (エンヴィー);Envy  ;"
Envy is a homunculus who has the ability of shape-shifting. They use this power to assume the form of any person and even copy their voice. They usually serves as a spy, but their abilities are also extremely useful for assassinations. Envy may not be as smart as some of the other homunculi, but is by no means an idiot. In fact, they can be just as good a puppet master as Lust, but this is overshadowed by their cockiness and bad temper. Their temper can easily be set off by insulting their large and delicate ego, causing them to make mistakes.


In the 2003 anime series:
As the oldest Homunculus, Envy claimed that he had forgotten what he originally looked like. Envy also greatly hates all humans and followed Dante mostly for the opportunity of killing as many people as he could. This is what drove Envy in all that he did and unlike other Homunculi, Envy does not care about the Philosopher's Stone, nor about becoming human.


Towards the very end of the series it is revealed that Envy was created four hundred years ago by Hohenheim in an attempt to resurrect the son he and Dante had, who later died from mercury poisoning when he was eighteen years old. Envy held a great hatred toward Hohenheim for never being acknowledged as his son and for abandoning him and Dante.

In the manga and 2009 anime series:
Envy was the fourth Homunculus created by Father. Though often referred to as a 'he' Envy is apparently genderless and can take almost any form they choose. Referred to by Lust as the most cruel or sadistic of the Homunculi, Envy shows the most open disdain of humans and relishes in any opportunity to hurt, humiliate, or insult them. They are also quite vain and short tempered and dislike anyone insulting their appearance.


Beneath this cruel exterior however Envy is secretly envious of humans' inner strength and the mutually beneficial friendships that they share, since most of the Homunculi show little real concern or emotional support for each other.

Likes: sweets, alcohol, Shounen Jump, strawberry milk, pachinko

Favorite quote:
""Then and now, what I protect has never changed.""
Occupation: Yorozuya/Odd Jobs

Gintoki is a samurai living in an era when samurai are no longer needed. To add to his troubles, oppressive aliens have moved in to invade planet Earth. Gintoki works taking on odd jobs alongside two kids: Kagura and Shinpachi. In the Joui war, he was known as the ""White Devil"" (Shiroyasha) due to his silver hair and white clothing he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear in the hearts of the Amanto.

Gintoki has naturally permed silver hair, which he blames for his lacking love-life. He has a big crush on the TV's news weather girl, Ketsuno. In fact, to date, the only time he is seen to have blushed is when he tries to make use of Sadaharu and Ketsuno's dog to get a chance to talk to her.(Though he later does with Tsukuyo as well when she discovers him shopping) Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response and merely puts up with them as annoyances.

Gintoki has two major obsessions in life. He is obsessed with sweet food such as parfaits, ice cream and cakes. His second obsession is reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Shounen Jump. (Which, not coincidentally, is where Gintama is published). Gintoki will go to great lengths to get the latest Jump issue, to the point of reckless behavior. His Jump obsession makes him dream of being like other Jump heroes, including wishing that he had a ""Bankai"" similar to the characters of Bleach.

Despite his appearance and initial behavior, Gintoki has a great amount of pride for the old bushido code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he's barely acquainted with, be it a pit-fighter who was taking care of abandoned orphans or an Amanto who resembles a kappa.

Despite being a fearsome fighter with nearly unmatched skills, he avoids needless bloodshed after suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joui war.

Kagura;Kagura  (神楽);"Kagura ""Gura, China Girl, Leader, Gurako"" ";"
Age: 14
Birthday: November 3
Zodiac: Scorpio
Height: 155 cm
Weight: 40 kg

Kagura, meaning ""god-entertainment"" is a member of the Yorozuya alongside Sakata Gintoki and Shinpachi Shimura and the main female protagonist of Gintama.

Although she appears to be a normal, cute, human girl in Chinese-style clothing, she actually belongs to the Yato Clan, one of the strongest and most bloodthirsty of the Amanto races. The Yato people are said to have ""transparent"" skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan's weapon of choice; Kagura's is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motor-scooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise by her hands.

She is also extremely flexible and fast; capable of catching multiple speeding bullets between her teeth and fingers. During battle, she's often seen flipping through the air and performing various acrobatic feats. Due to her Yato blood, she is capable of rapid regeneration. During the Benizakura arc, she is seen healing from a gunshot wound almost overnight.

Kagura also has an unusually strong appetite. She is able to consume large quantities of food within a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, her tastes are endearingly plain. Sukonbu, rice, and eggs are among her favorite foods.

Her immediate family consists of her father, Umibouzu, a widely recognized alien hunter, her mother, who is deceased, and her older brother Kamui, once presumed missing who is now involved with the space pirates Harusame.

She came to Earth to earn money for her family. She found work fighting for a gang, but when they ordered her to kill her target, she ran away. Not long afterward, she met Gintoki and Shinpachi when Gintoki accidentally ran her down with his scooter. After they helped her to make a clean break from the gang, she intimidated Gintoki into hiring her. She now lives at the Yorozuya and sleeps in Gintoki's closet, like Doraemon.

Kagura and Gintoki share an odd brother-younger sister-like relationship. Together with Shinpachi, the three of them makes for a strange, dysfunctional, yet tightly knit family. Kagura is very protective of Gintoki. Although she herself has gotten into many fights with him, she rarely lets anyone else pick on him. She seems to trust wholeheartedly in Gintoki's ability and strength. Even in sticky situations, she has no doubt that Gin-chan would come and save her. She has a tendency to imitate Gintoki's bad habits (like picking her nose or swearing, hence her unladylike behavior) and would often quote the bad advice he gives her. Some of her lines start with ""Gin-chan says..."" or ""Gin-chan told me...""

Kagura is also somewhat of a tomboy. She is often seen partaking in games with various neighborhood boys. Although her candid manner of speech often causes them to shun her, she doesn't seem to mind. In fact, she has no problem at all with forcing her way into their game. In battle, she has proven to be bull-headed and a sore loser. Like Gintoki, and probably because of his influence, she is not above resorting to petty tricks and manipulation to get the better of her adversary. Unlike many conventional manga heroines, she doesn't display the same consciousness toward decorum, table manners, and physical appearance. Puking, cussing, picking her nose, spitting, fighting, and scratching herself are common behavior for Kagura.

She regards Okita, captain of the Shinsengumi, as a rival. She detests him and appeared to be disgusted when she previously mentioned (about Okita), that ""he definitely likes me,"" but as that hasn't been brought up since, it is uncertain on if it should be considered canon, that he apparently likes her.

Although Kagura usually teases Shinpachi, she deeply cares for him and thinks of him as a brother. She also shows great respect toward his older sister, Shimura Tae, often calling her ""Anego"" (a term gangster women use to show respect).

Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu (being her 27th pet), have met with an untimely demise by her hands (with the exception of Sadaharu 28,' a beetle killed by Okita). She cuddles with Sadaharu when feeling down. Kagura also seems to be the only one (aside from Ane, Mone, and Komako) who Sadaharu listens to.

According to the OVA, Kagura is the first and only Weekly Shonen Jump girl to vomit on-screen. To date, she has induced herself to vomit on several occasions. She also has an uncanny knack for seeming calm or detached during high-tension situations; in episode 5, she slept through a car-chase. Her appetite knows no bounds, and she is especially fond of sukonbu.

In Japanese, Kagura speaks in a stereotypical dialect that is associated with Chinese immigrants. In the English-translated manga, she punctuates her sentences with yup, uh-huh (aru), nope, and the like.


In the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura meets her older brother, Kamui who abandoned her because she was weak in his eyes. During the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura and Shinpachi teamed up against a Yato veteran named Abuto. When Shinpachi was mortally wounded by Abuto, Kagura can no longer hold against her Yato blood and revealed her true inner killing instincts against Abuto. Abuto is easily overwhelmed by Kagura's true power.
In the last Gintama character popularity poll, she came in the 6th place."

Birthdate: August 12
Zodiac: Leo
Height: 166 cm
Weight: 55 kg
Age: 16

Shinpachi Shimura works under Gintoki to learn the ways of the samurai. He used to stay at his family's dōjo. However, it seems more like he's just trying to help Gintoki pay the rent than to learn. Shinpachi is the captain of the ""Otsu's Imperial Guard,"" a pop-singer's fan club.

Shinpachi meets Gintoki after Shinpachi was tripped by the ambassador of Planet Chatoran. Gintoki beats up the ambassador and his guards, not to stand up for Shinpachi, but to get revenge for his spilled parfait. Gintoki frames Shinpachi for the crime, which somehow led to him saving Shimura Tae (Otae), Shinpachi's sister, from becoming part of a brothel.

Despite his meek appearance, Shinpachi is a more than competent swordsman of his family's Kakidō-Ryu, the type of swordmanship his dojo teaches.

In the character popularity poll, he was in 8th place.

His name is roughly based on Shinsengumi member Nagakura Shinpachi and comedian Ken Shimura."

Species: human
Gender: male
Birthday: May 5 (Children's Day in Japan)
Zodiac: Taurus
Age: 27
Blood type: A
Height: 177 cm
Weight: 64 kg
Others: right-handed, chain smoker
Affiliations: Shinsengumi

Hijikata is the famed chain smoking, vice commander of the Shinsengumi so named by his subordinates, because of his fearsome demeanor. Purportedly the brains behind the force, he takes his work seriously, and is fiercely loyal to his leader, Isao Kondo.

Hijikata has a reputation as a fearsome leader, earning the nickname of ""demonic vice-commander."" He is also hot-tempered and often speaks of seppuku. However, despite his cold exterior, he does have a more compassionate side. He also has a tendency to cry after watching movies that are not particularly emotional.

Hijikata is obsessed with mayonnaise and thus has the nickname ""Mayora."" He has been known to smother anything he eats under a mountain of mayonnaise, and he carries a number of objects shaped like jars of mayonnaise, such as his cigarette lighter. He was popular with girls until they discovered this obsession.

He enjoys fighting and sees Gintoki as a rival in practically everything he does from drinking contests to rock, paper, scissors ever since being defeated by him in battle. He is in constant danger of being killed by the attempts on his life by Okita. But, despite all this, he sees Okita as one of his close friends, and vice versa.

Before joining Shinsengumi, he used to be a trouble-maker ronin. He enjoys fighting/having a good fight and says he doesn't care how many Amanto buildings get blown up, he only looks forward to having a big battle with the Joui rebels after Shinsengumi has rounded them in 1 fell swoop, in Episode 5.

He also formulated the Kyokuchuu Hatto, the 45 Regulations that form the disciplinary framework for Shinsengumi members, and implements them firmly.

Age: 18
Birthdate: July 8
Height: 170 cm
Weight: 58 kg
Occupation: First Division Captain Shinsengumi

Okita is the best swordsman in the Shinsengumi. Personality-wise, he tends to be light-hearted and somewhat childish though his speech is heavily deadpan.

He outwardly displays annoyance and dislike for Hijikata, and continuously tries to harm and humiliate him whenever given the chance.


Losing his parents at a young age, he was raised by his sister, Mitsuba. Thus, although he is sadistic and violent towards other people, Okita absolutely adores his sister and does everything he can to please her. Mitsuba is one of the reasons why Okita hates Hijikata. Okita viewed Hijikata as a rival for his sister's attention. He also greatly dislikes the fact that Hijikata treated Mitsuba coldly, although Mitsuba clearly showed signs of liking Hijikata.
Okita has great affection and fondness for Kondo, who took him under his wings when he was little. He still regards Hijikata as one of his three friends (the other two being Kondo and Gintoki).

He enjoys seeing women fight, finding the ugly looks on their faces as they grab each other being hilarious. He wears a distinctive eye mask when taking a nap during duty, which is a frequent occurrence. At one point, he refers to himself as the best sniper in the Shinsengumi. Although he is a master of kenjutsu, he uses a bazooka more often.

He also regards Kagura as a rival after an unfinished rock-paper-scissors duel during a sakura-blossom party. He states that he'll ""be the only one to defeat her"", and usually calls her ""China"".

In the original Japanese manga he likes to end his sentences in ""~desaa"" and ""~desuzee.""

In Sorachi's original character design, Okita was a female, and wielded an umbrella. This concept was ultimately given to Kagura.

In the second Shounen JUMP character popularity poll, he ranked 2nd place, just below Gintoki.

In volume 12, Okita's age is revealed to be 18. Despite being under Japan's legal drinking age, in Edo, you can drink alcohol from 15.

His name is based on the historical Okita Souji."
Katsura, Kotarou;Kotarou Katsura (桂 小太郎);"Kotarou ""Zura, Fruits Punch Samurai, Zurako, Captain Katsura, Katsuo"" Katsura";"
Age: 20s
Birthday: June 26 (Cancer)
Height: 175 cm
Weight: 56 kg
Blood Type: AB

Katsura is Gintoki's former comrade during the Joi war. Even after the Amanto take-over of Japan, Katsura continues to resist the Amanto, and has amassed a band of followers. His weapon of choice is a metallic grenade. He is a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, and is constantly on the run from the Shinsengumi. Although his initial methods were originally more violent in nature (for instance, sending a bomb to an Amanto embassy), Katsura has gradually grown to believe that there are people important to him in Edo, and decides that he no longer wants to destroy the country, but believes there should be a way to change it without causing sacrifices.

Katsura seems to be highly respected by his followers, and has even been called the ""Daybreak of the Joui Faction"" by some. When people believed that Katsura had died during the Benizakura arc, even other terrorist groups tried to avenge his death.
Since he is a wanted man, Katsura is often seen wearing disguises, although his identity is often still easily found out. One example of a disguise he seems to be fond of is a pirate's costume, complete with an eyepatch (with a skull design) over his left eye and a scar on his right cheek, and using this he calls himself 'Space Captain Katsura'.

Katsura seems to possess a rather outdated sense of humour, and sometimes refers to things from a past era, such as when he tried to buy a Famicon when people were queuing up to buy the OwEe (a parody of the Wii). He also seems to have a tendency to make up dramatic stories, which moves others to tears when they hear these stories (except Gintoki).
Katsura sometimes works odd jobs (e.g. in Episode 88), to raise money for his terrorist activities. He claims that his heart has started to be moved by Ikumatsu in episode 39 (chapter 55 equivalent of the manga), and held his subsequent interview in her ramen restaurant.

In the Japanese version, Gintoki often calls him ""Zura."" In the first English volume, Gintoki calls him ""Casserole,"" or ""Cough syrup."" Eventually, the English version changed to Gintoki calling Katsura ""Zura."" In the Japanese version, Katsura indignantly replies ""Not 'Zura'! It's Katsura!"" (and will do so anytime he is called something other than his name). In the English version he replies ""Not Casserole! It's Katsura!"" The Japanese version joke is a pun, since ""Katsura"" can mean wig in Japanese and ""Zura"" is slang for the same thing. The English version is also a wordplay since ""Katsura"" and ""Casserole"" sound somewhat similar in pronunciation. He has the uncanny ability to know when someone has called him something other than Katsura, even in their head. An example being in Episode 25 as a guest to Gintoki's hotpot dinner.

His name is based on the historical Katsura Kogoro."

Age: 38

Zodiac: Gemini
Height: 179 cm
Weight: 67 kg

Hasegawa used to be an official working for the Bakufu, but after an unfortunate incident with Amanto dignitary Prince Hata, whom he was assigned to serve and protect, his superior asked him to succumb to his shame and commit seppuku, hearing that he ran away from his quarters.

He initially believed that humans should focus on appeasing the Amanto, but after his encounter with Gintoki, his mindset changed, which led to him punching Hata out, thus getting fired. Since then, he has been living a life of somewhat like a loser, getting fired almost every time he gets a new job, mostly due to the unfavourable look his sunglasses and goatee give him.

No matter what, he refuses to remove his sunglasses because it's the only thing he had left to remind him of his successful past. Although he does exchange the sunglasses for a decent pair of half-moon spectacles at one point, he goes back to wearing them after he decides that he is going to live out his life in the best way he can. He is constantly seen working various part-time jobs. He is often referred to as ""Madao,"" short for ""marude damena ossan,"" which roughly translates into ""totally useless middle-aged man.""

He and Gintoki are on good terms with one another and seem to spend most of their free time gambling. He often plays pachinko, but rarely ever wins. After losing his job for the Bakufu, he is seen doing odd jobs from time to time, like running a supermarket for a friend or driving a taxi at one time.

He's currently estranged from his wife Hatsu, because of his jobless lifestyle, however they still keep in touch.

It is revealed in episode 52 that he is 38 years old after he pees his pants."
Tsukuyo;Tsukuyo  (月詠);"Tsukuyo ""Tsukki, The Moon of Yoshiwara, Shinigami Tayuu"" ";"
Birthday: February 9
Height: 170 cm (5' 7"")
Weight: 52 kg (114 lb)

Tsukuyo is a blonde-haired woman with a scar over her forehead and left cheek. One of the better known Hundred Blooms of Yoshiwara, a law enforcement squad of Yoshiwara that consists of all females, deployed by the Night King Hosen. Despite appearing to be a heartless person when approached by Odd Jobs when he arrives to Yoshiwara, throwing a fake kunai to their foreheads, she later becomes friends with them. She has a difficult past being orphaned as a child, only to be picked up and raised by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. While the original motive for Jiraia was to instill every bit of despair and tragedy of his own life into Tsukuyo, of who he refers to as his art or perfect creation, Tsukuyo ended up growing attached to what he did not manage to do. That is ""Friends, A Home, and Precious Things To Protect"" as told by Jiraia. Her loyalty and home lies with Hinowa in the underground city of Yoshiwara. She has ties with Hinowa, who also helped raise her like an older sister/mother through her childhood.


It is hinted by Jiraia (in Chapter 255/Episode 178) Hinowa and Seita (in Chapter 294) that she has romantic feelings for Gintoki. This is further supported by her scribbling out statements from Hinowa's and Seita's New Year's cards commenting how lonely she was when they heard Gintoki has gotten married and her inability to give him chocolates for Valentine's Day (in Episode 204). Tsukyo herself has confirmed that, while she doesn't quite know what they are or what to do with them, she has some feelings towards Gintoki. This was in episode 177 when she said to him, ""When I am with you, my resolve weakens. Don't shake up my feelings any further.""

Takasugi, Shinsuke;Shinsuke Takasugi (高杉晋助);Shinsuke  Takasugi;"
Age: 20s
Birthday: August 10
Zodiac: Leo
Hair: Black (purple highlights)
Eyes: Light Olive Green (bandage over left eye)
Height: 170cm
Weight: 60kg
Occupation: Leader of the Kiheitai
Hobbies: Smoking a pipe, Playing a shamisen

A former comrade of Gintoki and Katsura and a major antagonist. He now leads a radical Joui faction called the Kiheitai and is known amongst the Shinsengumi as 'the most dangerous man in both the Joui faction and amongst the radicals'. He is easily recognizable through his bandaged left eye, his colorful kimono, his eerie smile, and the pipe he is often seen smoking.

He, Gintoki, and Katsura studied in the same temple elementary school when they were children, and he fought with them against the Amanto invasion during the latter part of the Joui war. After the war ended, he vanished, and has since gained a dangerous reputation due to his assassination of many of the Bakufu's main officers and his planning of a large-scale coup d'etat. Before his first appearance in both the anime and the manga, he was mentioned to have fled Edo and to have been hiding in Kyoto, although it is unclear how long before this was.

He now believes that the only way to save it is to destroy the ""rotten"" post-Joui war world.

He is shown to like festivals, although this is mainly due to the opportunity they provide for a large-scale terrorist attack: he appears to have an attraction to ruin that is almost nihilistic. He also appears to have considerable insight due to his 'seeing through Itou's heart' and subsequently planting him in the Shinsengumi's ranks.

It can be assumed that he is as skilled a swordsman as both Gintoki and Katsura, having fought alongside them as one of the 'heroes' of the Joui war. That aside, he appears to have at least considerable skill in playing the shamisen, and is shown at one point playing it with Bansai as they talk.

He is based on the historical Takasugi Shinsaku."

Kamui is a member of the Yato Tribe, the son of Umibouzu and older brother of Kagura. His excellent fighting skills helped him become Captain of the 7th Division of Harusame's Thunder Guns, the most powerful combat unit within the Harusame group and Overlord of Yoshiwara. Since defecting from the Harusame, he no longer holds these positions.

Kamui firmly believes that the Yato are to remain on the battlefield and shows his disapproval of Housen staying locked up in Yoshiwara. Because of this belief, he shows no pity towards family or subordinates as a sign of weakness is unacceptable. He tried to revive the abandoned tradition of Yato clan's men killing their own parent to prove their strength, although failed to successfully execute it and only cut his father's arm off.

Despite this, he pays respect to the opponents he kills by sending them off with a smile. He doesn't kill children, and dislikes killing women because they may give birth to strong children."

Birthdate: December 14
Height: 177 cm (5'10"")
Weight: 60 kg

Okabe Rintarou is the main protagonist of Steins;Gate. He is a first year student attending Tokyo Denki University, and calls himself a Crazy Mad Scientist. He acts like a villain, but is rather immature as he frequently shows traits of Chunibyou (中二病) syndrome despite being a grown-up man. After enrolling in university, he went to Akihabara to open up a laboratory called the ""Future Gadget Research Establishment,"" where he invents gadgets that are rather useless. He also talks to himself on the cellphone, his words not making much sense. Supposedly, he has very few friends that can understand what he's talking about.

Okabe often refers to himself as, ""Hououin Kyouma"" (鳳凰院凶真).

However, Mayuri and Daru just call him ""Okarin"" (オカリン), abbreviated after his name.

The phrase he uses to end conversations, particularly with himself, is ""El Psy Congroo"" (エル・プサイ・コングルゥ).


Eventually, he falls in love with, and confesses to Makise Kurisu.

In the future of the Alpha world line, Okabe became the leader of the resistance against SERN's rule, and was known as an international terrorist (in the side story """"The Far Valhalla,"""" it's revealed that SERN released Okabe and Daru so that they could found the resistance, thus completing the cycle of fate). Okabe got captured by SERN's Rounder unit in 2025 and was tortured to death.

In the events of Deja Vu, Makise Kurisu is the one who gives Okabe the backstory and name of Hououin Kyouma.

Blood type: A
Height: 160 cm
Weight: 45 kg

The female protagonist. Kurisu is a research member in Victor Qondria University's Brain Research Program. Her age group matches that of third-year high schoolers, but she skipped a grade through America's educational system. She is also famous in America for writing theses papers, part of which is covered in the news. Thanks to skipping a grade in America as a girl, she was envied by people around her, and ended up building a strong personality. She does not want to show weakness to others, so she always has a stern expression. However, she is very curious, and when she builds interest, she pokes into things. Occasionally, she has views that differ from regular opinions, such as, ""The experiment data is more important than the subject's privacy."" Rintarou often tells her, ""Hey, you've got a pretty good sense of being a Mad Scientist,"" but she is not one to agree to such things personally. She is a tsundere.

Rintarou has given her plenty of nicknames, in particular ""Christina"" (クリスティーナ) and ""Assistant"" (助手).


In the future of the Alpha world line where SERN rules, Makise worked for them. She made major contributions to the completion of SERN's time machine and was praised as ""Mother of Time Machine."" In the side story ""The Far Valhalla,"" which explores Kurisu's, Okabe's, and Daru's fate after being captured by SERN, it's revealed that Okabe devised a plan to escape from SERN's headquarter in France, but as SERN learned that it would rule the world in the future, it let Okabe and Daru go in order to complete the cycle of fate. Kurisu gave up and stayed behind, but still believed that Okabe would be able to overcome fate. In 2034, she completed the time machine and was executed by SERN. Kurisu's allegiance with SERN in the future is the reason Suzuha, a member of the resistance against SERN's rule in 2036, is initially distrustful of her. However, Suzuha's opinion changes after she learns more about Kurisu's nature. Kurisu and her father are not on the best terms. When she was little, her father's lectures would fascinate her so much that she would read up on them herself. It was not long before she started getting into the science field. Because of her talent, she would always outsmart her own father, causing the two to come to bad terms.

Kurisu develops feelings toward Okabe.

Though she'd like to ease the situation in such cases, she's not really good at reading between the lines. She often went with her grandmother to see the stars on her grandmother's back. Because of that, she has a habit of reaching her arm out to the sky at times, which has led Rintarou to naming it the ""Stardust Shakehand."" She abruptly does this (even if she's talking with someone), which surprises everyone around her.

Plenty of statements he makes could be taken as sexual harassment. He and Rintarou have known each other since high school. Usually turns down Rintarou's ridiculous requests as ""annoying,"" but in truth gets them done in proper order. However, he trusts Rintarou as a friend. Has great confidence in his programming and hacking abilities (he doesn't mind being called a Super Hacker, but doesn't like it when people call him Super Haker). He's always in front of the computer.

Has the nickname ""Daru"" (ダル), abbreviated after his name.


It was later revealed in the series that he is Suzuha's father, pointed out by Mayuri. In the future of the Alpha world line, he and Okabe became the founders of the resistance against SERN's rule (in the side story ""The Far Valhalla,"" it's revealed that SERN released them after their capture so that they could found the resistance, thus completing the cycle of fate). He met his wife, a cosplayer named Amane Yuki, in the Winter Comiket after returning from SERN's headquarter in France. After Okabe was killed in 2025, he continued with the research of the time machine and invented one in 2036. After that, he was assassinated. His time machine is what Suzuha used to travel to the past, but as it was incomplete (unlike the time machine Kurisu made in 2034), it couldn't be used to travel to the future.

She is very helpful and a little too familiar with things, but doesn't dig too deep. She's also not quite comfortable with having other people help her. Her personality drastically changes when it comes to her own interests. She is proactive and has a habit of using strange and difficult vocabulary at times, but somehow you can tell she's purposely doing so. She ended up hanging out with the Future Gadget Laboratory since she started working at the CRT TV Workshop.


It is revealed in Episode 14 that she came from the year 2036 to save the world from SERN's rule. Therefore, she used the name John Titor on Internet boards so that Okabe and the others would notice. She was the one who sent the time machine crashing into Akihabara in 2010, right when the Phone Microwave was being developed. This time machine, revealed to have been created by Daru, could only go back in time, but could never go to the future. In order to find the IBN 5100, Suzuha decides to go back to 1975 and then bring it to Okabe to stop SERN. In deciding so, she would have to leave 2010 and wouldn't be able to come back. Dedicated to her mission, she decides to go. A few hours after her departure, Okabe and the others receive a letter from her, written in the year 2000. It revealed that she had failed to retrieve the PC, due to the time machine's malfunction, causing her to lose her memory until the year 2000. It was revealed by Mr. Braun that she had committed suicide that day, but thanks to the D-Mail Okabe sent, her death changed from suicide to illness. This caused the meter to raise its number, but not up to 1%. In the Drama CD, it's revealed that after going back to 1975, she later became a professor in Akiha Yukitaka's and Nakabachi (then Makise Shouichi)'s university, and started their interest in the creation of a time machine.

Moeka is a part-time editor whom Okarin encounters in Akiba. She is practically glued to her phone and cannot function without it. Even when face to face, Moeka prefers to communicate by email.
She eventually became Lab Mem 005, joining in episode 6. Moeka joined because Okarin didn't want her to leak the PhoneWave secret.
She is searching for the legendary retro PC known as the IBN 5100.


Moeka was a constantly bullied social outcast, she desperately tried to make friends and find a place to belong, but failed miserably due to her social paranoia. In 2004, she fell into a deep depression due to hating everything and being hopeless, thinking that she no longer had a reason to live, Moeka decided to suicide. She drank several sleeping pills, hoping that she would die, but to no avail. As the pills were not working, her final attempt was to jump off a large building. At that moment, she received a mail from the enigmatic FB recruiting her to the Rounders, a SERN unit, changing her life forever. As FB often communicated with Moeka and acted as a mother-figure towards her, speaking with Moeka about her problems and comforting her, she came to see FB as the person that gave her life meaning and devoted every waking moment to sending mails to them and carrying out their given orders, developing a dependency on FB and their mails. While Moeka is capable of carrying out atrocities for acceptance's sake, she strives to be loved and has the potential to be a good person if led in the right direction.

In episode 12, she kills Mayuri at FB's order. However, Moeka was just a fate tool on that subject, since Mayuri is fated to die on the Alpha Attractor Field due to Okarin's D-Mails. In the visual novel, Okarin and Moeka confront Yuugo about the IBN5100, he later reveals to them that he is FB and that FB is the initials of Ferdinand Braun. Pulling a gun on Moeka, Yuugo admitted that he was FB, pretending to be a woman to appeal to Moeka's insecurity; he also informs the two that Rounders who complete their missions are killed by him. Okarin proceeds to reveal the truth about Hashida Suzu, the woman who took care of Yuugo and became a mother figure to him. After he found out the relation Hashida Suzu had to the time machine and the future, he regretted his actions, and committed suicide to protect Nae and Moeka, as he wanted to save the latter. His death caused Nae to become vengeful, especially against Okarin and Moeka. She later became the Rounder commander, and killed Okarin in 2025, then time-leaped 15,000 times back to the time of Moeka's death to kill her and warn Okarin of his death. As Moeka dies, she apologized to Okarin for Mayuri's death. Believing that her death is her punishment for killing Mayuri and that Okarin is right to hate her, as she would kill to protect the place she belongs. (FB's affection and care towards her) Reminding himself that Moeka did not kill Mayuri in this timeline, Okarin forgives Moeka as she dies. In episode 20 of the anime, she discovers that FB is Tennouji Yuugo, and that he was manipulating her to find an IBN5100. She's later shot by him and remembers that she killed Mayuri on various time lines. As Moeka dies, she repeatedly apologized to Okarin for Mayuri's death.

In the Gamma world line, Moeka is saved by Okarin and he recruited her to the Rounders. She considers him and FB her family and, though not realising, harbors feeling towards Okarin. She can talk normally on this world line, but she still has some difficulties."
Tennouji, Yuugo;Yuugo Tennouji (天王寺 裕吾);"Yuugo ""Mr. Braun"" Tennouji";"
Owner of the CRT TV Workshop set up in the first floor of the Oohiyama building. Also the landlord. Widower. Has an only daughter by the name of Nae, though he's the only one who loves CRTs. Hates LCDs with a passion, and perhaps anarchic. Though he's not quite enthusiastic in the CRT TV Workshop, for some reason he doesn't seem like he'd go bankrupt anytime soon. Nicknamed ""Mr. Braun"" by Rintarou, due to the loan word ""Braun"" used in the Japanese term for CRTs (ブラウン管).


In the Alpha world line, Yuugo lost both his parents and started living in the slums. After witnessing a jellyman who appeared near him, a group of SERN Rounders recruited him. In 1996, he's ordered to go to Akihabara to collect an IBN5100. He later acquainted Suzuha (who traveled back to 1975 and took the name ""Hashida Suzu"") and was taken care of by her for some time and eventually became a mother figure to him, and a girl named Imamiya Tsuzuri, who later becomes his wife. Suzu later has her body interior slowly jellyfied and dies, much to Yuugo and Tsuzuri's dismay. In 2001, SERN Rounders invaded Yuugo's house and captured Tsuzuri while she was pregnant with their second child, due to Yuugo forgetting about his mission and living a peaceful life, and turned her into a jellyman.

In episode 20, it is revealed that he's actually a veteran SERN henchman. Yuugo commands the Rounder unit (including Moeka) in Akihabara, under SERN's order to search for the IBN 5100. After Moeka successfully stole it, he was responsible for transferring the computer to SERN. In the VN (canon), after he found out the relation Hashida Suzu had to the time machine and the future, he regretted his actions, and committed suicide to protect Nae and Moeka, as he wanted to save the latter just like Suzu and Tsuzuri saved him. His death caused Nae to become vengeful, especially against Okarin and Moeka. She later became the Rounder commander, and killed Okabe in 2025, then time-leaped 15,000 times back to the time of his death to kill Moeka and warn Okarin of his death. In the anime, after Moeka and Rintarou found out about his identity, he confessed that he got close to Suzuha due to SERN's order. As Rounder members were to kill themself after finishing their mission, in order to protect his daughter, he killed Moeka and himself.

Yang, Wen-li;Wen-li Yang (ヤン・ウェンリー);"Wen-li ""Miracle Yang, Magician Yang, The Hero of El Facil"" Yang";"
Birthdate: April 4, 767 U.C.

Yang Wenli is a commodore, currently serving in the 2nd fleet of the Free Planets Alliance.

The son of a merchant and a pacifist at heart, Yang never wanted to be a soldier; his dream was to become a historian, but he didn't have the money to pay for his tuition and joined the army to get a scholarship. He barely made it through the officer's academy due to his lack of interest, though he did make a number of friends there including Dusty Attenborough and Jean Robert Lap. He also met music student Jessica Edwards and both him and Lap developed a crush on her, Jessica eventually chose Lap, Yang accepted her decision and they remained friends.

Soon after he graduated, Yang became involved in a battle near the friendly planet El Facil, because of his superiors' incompetence and cowardice, the planet was abandoned while a hostile imperial fleet was on its way. Yang was one of the few officers that remained behind and tried to help the population, thanks to his efforts the planet was evacuated in time. Because of this achievement he became famous as ""the hero of El Facil"" and ""miracle Yang,"" forever earning the envy of his peers and the scorn of his superiors.

It was at El Facil that Yang first became interested in tactics, but ever since that incident and although he kept rising through the ranks, his novel tactical suggestions were being arbitrarily rejected by hostile superiors. Though disappointed and increasingly cynical with the state of affairs in the Alliance, Yang never stopped trying to do at least the absolute minimum to justify his salary and the pension he was so looking forward to.

Miracle Yang, also called ""the magician,"" is a genius tactician, as well as a competent strategist. Unlike his often proud adversaries, Yang is more than willing to resort to trickery and his only flaw as a commander lies with his inability to go against the orders of his superiors. Yang holds democracy in an extremely high esteem and has a well-defined political philosophy, providing much insight to anyone willing to listen to him. In his personal life he appears to be quite slothful, he is notoriously incompetent with house chores, as well as in all things romantic. After serving on the Patorokolos in the start of the series, Yang eventually gets the battleship Hyperion as he his given command of the 13th fleet, and this becomes his flagship during the coming conflic­ts."
von Lohengramm, Reinhard;Reinhard von Lohengramm (ラインハルト・フォン・ローエングラム);"Reinhard ""von Müsel, Golden Lion, Golden Brat, Blonde Brat, Kinpatsu no Kozou"" von Lohengramm";"
Birthdate: March 14, 467 R.C. (776 U.C.)

Count Reinhard von Lohengramm is a young admiral in the Galactic Empire.

He was born Reinhard von Müsel to an impoverished aristocratic family. His mother died when he was very young and he only has faint memories of her. His father's will was shattered at about the same time and the only person left to care for young Reinhard was his beloved older sister Annerose. When Reinhard was about ten years old, his family had to move into a middle class suburban neighborhood. There he met Siegfried Kircheis who would become his best and perhaps only friend, but whatever happiness Reinhard managed to find as a child was to be short-lived.

The emperor Friedrich IV took a liking to his sister and ordered her to move into his palace and become his new concubine. Afraid that if she refused she would bring down the emperor's wrath on her younger brother, Annerose reluctantly accepted and her father even managed to get some money out of it. Infuriated Reinhard swore vengeance against the emperor, vengeance against the Goldenbaum dynasty and vengeance against the oppressive nobility. He swore that he would never rest until he freed his sister of her predicament and became powerful enough never to be ordered by anyone again.

To achieve his goals and with Kircheis by his side, Reinhard joined the military. He quickly rose through the ranks and after proving his ability time and again to the hostile and corrupt nobility, ever reluctant to accept a fallen aristocrat like him into their ranks, he became an imperial high admiral and was elevated to peerage as the ""count of Lohengramm"". As he steps into the admiralty, the Emperor gives him the prototype battleship Brünhild, which serves as Reinhards flagship from then on.

Nicknamed ""Blonde Brat"" by his enemies and ""Golden Lion"" by his friends, Reinhard is a handsome and gifted individual, a superb tactician and an unequaled strategist. Brave and noble, he always leads his fleets from the front, much to the admiration, as well as the horror, of his subordinates. Ambitious and determined, Reinhard is only hindered by his immeasurable pride, his warlike nature and the turmoil in his heart."
von Reuenthal, Oskar;Oskar von Reuenthal (オスカー・フォン・ロイエンタール);"Oskar ""Bewitching Eyes"" von Reuenthal";"
Birthdate: October 26, 458 R.C. (767 U.C.)

Oskar von Reuenthal is a rear admiral serving in Reinhard's fleet and, along with Wolfgang Mittermeyer, Reinhard's ablest field commander.

Reuenthal was born to a lowly, but rich noble father and a mother from a distinguished but impoverished line that only married his father for his material affluence. Reuenthal was born with a rare condition called heterochromia, one of his eyes is blue, while the other is brown. Since both his parents had blue eyes, this was seen as proof of his mother's adultery. His mother committed suicide after trying to pluck out his brown eye while he was still an infant. Reuenthal's father put the blame on him and he grew up hated and neglected.

Reuenthal joined the military and rose through the ranks rather quickly, finding in war the reason he needed to keep on living. While stationed in fortress Iserlohn, he met Wolfgang Mittermeyer and the two became close friends. Mittermeyer is probably the only person Reuenthal has managed to have a normal relationship with and he greatly values their friendship. When Mittermeyer was unjustly detained and in danger of assassination by the nobility, Reuenthal didn't hesitate to pledge his loyalty to Reinhard in return for his help with Mittermeyer's case.

Reuenthal appears calm and composed on the outside, he is a brilliant war strategist, second only to Reinhard, and an accomplished tactician, but Reuenthal is, in reality, a ticking bomb ready to go off at any moment and perhaps would have already exploded if not for Mittermeyer's soothing presence in his life. His problematic childhood has ridden him with an incredible amount of self-loathing and a complete inability to trust women, though handsome and successful with the opposite sex, he never manages to get into a healthy relationship. Proud and ambitious Reuenthal often contemplates treachery, but his respect towards Reinhard and the debt he owes him, manage to restrain him. His flagship is the Tristan."
von Oberstein, Paul;Paul von Oberstein (パウル・フォン・オーベルシュタイン);Paul  von Oberstein;"
Paul von Oberstein is a captain serving as chief of staff in fortress Iserlohn of the Galactic Empire. He was born blind and has to wear artificial eyes to see. He has nothing but contempt for his incompetent commander and despises the high nobles, realizing fully well the decadence of the Goldenbaum dynasty and how ignorant they are of the common people's plight. If he himself had been born a few years earlier, when the ""inferior genes exclusion law"" was still in effect, he would have been discarded as dangerous to the species. Because of that and realizing Reinhard's abilities, he wants to join his camp.

Oberstein is a genius strategist and organizer, both in war and politics. Calm and composed, he never shows any sign of emotional distress, everything he says and does is part of a well thought, reasonable plan."
Kircheis, Siegfried;Siegfried Kircheis (ジークフリード・キルヒアイス);Siegfried  Kircheis;"
Birth date: January 14, 467 R.C. (776 U.C.)

Siegfried Kircheis is a young captain serving in Reinhard's fleet, as well as his best friend.

Born a commoner, Kircheis first met the future Reinhard von Lohengramm when they both were about ten years old. Reinhard's family had just moved in the house next door, after introducing themselves to each other, Reinhard declared that Siegfried was a very common name and from then on he would call him Kircheis which sounded better, the two immediately stroke up a friendship that was to last for life.

When the emperor took Reinhard's sister to be his concubine, Annerose asked Kircheis, who had an innocent crush on her, to promise that he will always be by her brother's side. Kircheis kept his promise, he followed Reinhard in the military and together they rose through the ranks facing many trials, eventually Reinhard was made a count and was awarded the command of a fleet, opening their road to power.

Kircheis is an excellent tactician, often able to discern and even predict Reinhard's elaborate battle plans. A kind person and a dedicated friend to Reinhard, he is always by his side, and goes on the fight alongside him in his red colored battleship Barbarossa. He often acts as a restraint for Reinhard's ambition as well as his wrath when his arrogance gets the better of him. He believes both in Reinhard's abilities and the righteousness of his intentions and his only goal is to help Reinhard fulfill his destiny."
Mittermeyer, Wolfgang;Wolfgang Mittermeyer (ウォルフガング・ミッターマイヤー);"Wolfgang ""Gale Wolf"" Mittermeyer";"
Wolfgang Mittermeyer is a rear admiral serving in Reinhard's fleet and, along with Oskar von Reuenthal, Reinhard's ablest field commander.

Mittermeyer is a commoner, born to a middle-class family. He first met Reuenthal while stationed in fortress Iserlohn, early in his career, and the two became close friends. Kind and caring, Mittermeyer has been a stabilizing factor for Reuenthal's self-destructive tendencies ever since. A family man at heart Mittermeyer soon married his childhood sweetheart Evangeline and became a dedicated husband, but their efforts to have children have been fruitless thus far. Unfortunately for him, his lowly pedigree was about to cause him serious trouble.

Mittermeyer ordered the execution of one of his subordinates for assaulting, robbing and murdering a civilian woman. Although his decision was just, he turned out to belong to a powerful noble family and Mittermeyer was soon arrested. While the nobles plotted his death, desperate to save his only friend Reuenthal met with Reinhard von Müsel (later Lohengramm) and offered his and Mittermeyer's loyalty to him, in exchange for aid in saving Mittermeyer from the nobility and clearing his name. Reinhard, who had his own well-known issues with the nobles, readily accepted and both of them were transferred under his command.

Nicknamed ""the gale wolf,"" Mittermeyer is renowned for his boldness in warfare, his lightning responses to changing factors in the battlefield, as well as his ability to cover huge distances in a relatively short time, while keeping his fleet organized from his flagship Beowulf. Under Reinhard's command, he receives the flagship Beowulf. Mittermeyer is an able strategist and a brilliant tactician, one of the very best of his era. He is composed, just with his subordinates and fiercely loyal to Reinhard, not only for saving his life, but also because he honestly respects his abilities."

As such Julian was admitted in the wartime welfare program and, through the mediation of vice admiral Alex Cazellnu, he was made Yang Wenli's ward.

Julian is a very intelligent and responsible boy with a knack for house chores and is the one who takes care of the domestically incompetent Yang, so much so that their friends often wonder who amongst the two is the real guardian and who the ward. Julian loves Yang and deeply respects him, both for his kindness and his well-defined philosophy on life.

Yang wants a peaceful life for Julian, but, much to his disappointment, Julian's dream is to follow in his and his father's footsteps and become a soldier."
von Mariendorf, Hildegard;Hildegard von Mariendorf (ヒルデガルド・フォン・マリーンドルフ);"Hildegard ""Hilda"" von Mariendorf";"
Birthdate: 468 R.C. (777 U.C.)

Hildegard von Mariendorf is one of the principal characters in the series. She served as the New Galactic Fleet's Chief Advisor
She later reigned with Reinhard von Lohengramm when she became his wife and Empress in U.C. 801.

Hildegard, usually referred to by the nickname Hilda, was born in Galactic year 777 into an distinguished noble family of the Goldenbaum dynasty, the sole daughter of the benevolent and just Count Franz von Mariendorf. From an early age, she was distinguished from the other girls of the aristocrat society by her independent ideas. Completely unconcerned, Hilda pursued her own interests in reading, politics and history. Her mother having died when Hilda was young, her open-minded father respected Hilda's unique ideas and choices in life.

In U.C. 797, the old galactic empire spilt into civil war, where the old nobility stood against the new emerging camp of military elites lead by Reinhard von Lohengramm. Hilda convinced her father to plea allegiance to the latter, whereupon she met Reinhard for the first time and impressed him with the clarity of her insight. When the Lohengramm camp emerged victorious from the civil war, Reinhard gained complete political and military power in the empire, and Hilda became Reinhard's chief secretary and assisted him in the progressive reforms that swept across the empire.

From U.C. 798 to U.C. 800, Hilda played an active role on the galactic stage, advising Reinhard wisely on imperial policies and tactics, and became one of his most valued and trusted staff. During Operation Ragnarök, where the empire battled the Alliance, Hilda served as a staff officer and became the first female to board the Flagship Brünhild.
During the critical battle of Vermillion, she perceived that the situation was in Reinhard's disfavour, and persuaded Generals Mittermeyer and Reuentahl to mobilize forces against the Alliance capital, turning the war to Reinhard's tactical victory and saving his life. General Mittermeyer later praised Hilda that ""her intelligence is worth more than a fleet."" Her role gradually became more public after Reinhard's coronation as the first Emperor of the new Lohengramm Dynasty. In the year U.C. 800, in the Ninth Battle of Iserlohn, Hilda succeeded General Steinmetz to become the Fleet's Chief Advisor, formally capable of representing the Emperor and command on his behalf on the battlefield. Conscious of her military position, Hilda withheld her political role and refused to advise Reinhard on political matters, despite his repeated requests for her counsel. In August of U.C. 800, Reinhard was attacked by an assassin who sought vengeance for Reinhard's inaction in the Westland tragedy. Overcame with regret and emotional agony, Reinhard withdrew into his own quarters and Hilda entered to console him. Subconsciously realizing that his reliance on her has deepened past their professional relationship, he asked her to stay, and she agreed, determined to help him to the best of her abilities. The morning after, Reinhard came to Hilda's home and proposed marriage, and Hilda did not immediately reply for the uncertainty whether she can truly give him happiness. She also did not reveal her pregnancy to him until after the Urvashi affair and Reuentahl's subsequent rebellion, which deepened the insight of both Hilda and Reinhard toward their own feelings. When peace was restored, Hilda accepted Reinhard's second proposal, and they were married on January 19, U.C. 801. The officials of the empire greeted their new Empress with enthusiasm and joy. On May the 14th, while Reinhard was away at war, Hilda give birth to a son, whom Reinhard named Alexander Siegfried von Lohengramm. Reinhard's illness seriously exacerbated a mere sixteen days later and was diagnosed with a rare form mutative connective tissue disease, with no know cure. Despite the illness, Reinhard decided to return to the imperial capital for the sake of the people awaiting him there. On July the 18th, Reinhard and Hilda were re-united. On July the 26th, the dying Reinhard said his final words to Hilda: ""My Empress, you shall rule the universe more wisely than I. If you think setting up a constitution is the better way then so be it. The universe would be fine as long as the strongest and wisest among all the living governs it. If Alexander Seigfried lacks that ability, there is no need for Lohengramm dynasty to continue. Do everything as you wish; that is my greatest wish..."" He died at the age of twenty-five, with their son succeeding him and Hilda ruling as the Empress dowager. She was remembered by later historians as the person who nurtured the Lohengramm Empire to maturity."

Favorite quote:
""Then and now, what I protect has never changed.""
Occupation: Yorozuya/Odd Jobs

Gintoki is a samurai living in an era when samurai are no longer needed. To add to his troubles, oppressive aliens have moved in to invade planet Earth. Gintoki works taking on odd jobs alongside two kids: Kagura and Shinpachi. In the Joui war, he was known as the ""White Devil"" (Shiroyasha) due to his silver hair and white clothing he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear in the hearts of the Amanto.

Gintoki has naturally permed silver hair, which he blames for his lacking love-life. He has a big crush on the TV's news weather girl, Ketsuno. In fact, to date, the only time he is seen to have blushed is when he tries to make use of Sadaharu and Ketsuno's dog to get a chance to talk to her.(Though he later does with Tsukuyo as well when she discovers him shopping) Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response and merely puts up with them as annoyances.

Gintoki has two major obsessions in life. He is obsessed with sweet food such as parfaits, ice cream and cakes. His second obsession is reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Shounen Jump. (Which, not coincidentally, is where Gintama is published). Gintoki will go to great lengths to get the latest Jump issue, to the point of reckless behavior. His Jump obsession makes him dream of being like other Jump heroes, including wishing that he had a ""Bankai"" similar to the characters of Bleach.

Despite his appearance and initial behavior, Gintoki has a great amount of pride for the old bushido code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he's barely acquainted with, be it a pit-fighter who was taking care of abandoned orphans or an Amanto who resembles a kappa.

Despite being a fearsome fighter with nearly unmatched skills, he avoids needless bloodshed after suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joui war.

Kagura;Kagura  (神楽);"Kagura ""Gura, China Girl, Leader, Gurako"" ";"
Age: 14
Birthday: November 3
Zodiac: Scorpio
Height: 155 cm
Weight: 40 kg

Kagura, meaning ""god-entertainment"" is a member of the Yorozuya alongside Sakata Gintoki and Shinpachi Shimura and the main female protagonist of Gintama.

Although she appears to be a normal, cute, human girl in Chinese-style clothing, she actually belongs to the Yato Clan, one of the strongest and most bloodthirsty of the Amanto races. The Yato people are said to have ""transparent"" skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan's weapon of choice; Kagura's is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motor-scooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise by her hands.

She is also extremely flexible and fast; capable of catching multiple speeding bullets between her teeth and fingers. During battle, she's often seen flipping through the air and performing various acrobatic feats. Due to her Yato blood, she is capable of rapid regeneration. During the Benizakura arc, she is seen healing from a gunshot wound almost overnight.

Kagura also has an unusually strong appetite. She is able to consume large quantities of food within a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, her tastes are endearingly plain. Sukonbu, rice, and eggs are among her favorite foods.

Her immediate family consists of her father, Umibouzu, a widely recognized alien hunter, her mother, who is deceased, and her older brother Kamui, once presumed missing who is now involved with the space pirates Harusame.

She came to Earth to earn money for her family. She found work fighting for a gang, but when they ordered her to kill her target, she ran away. Not long afterward, she met Gintoki and Shinpachi when Gintoki accidentally ran her down with his scooter. After they helped her to make a clean break from the gang, she intimidated Gintoki into hiring her. She now lives at the Yorozuya and sleeps in Gintoki's closet, like Doraemon.

Kagura and Gintoki share an odd brother-younger sister-like relationship. Together with Shinpachi, the three of them makes for a strange, dysfunctional, yet tightly knit family. Kagura is very protective of Gintoki. Although she herself has gotten into many fights with him, she rarely lets anyone else pick on him. She seems to trust wholeheartedly in Gintoki's ability and strength. Even in sticky situations, she has no doubt that Gin-chan would come and save her. She has a tendency to imitate Gintoki's bad habits (like picking her nose or swearing, hence her unladylike behavior) and would often quote the bad advice he gives her. Some of her lines start with ""Gin-chan says..."" or ""Gin-chan told me...""

Kagura is also somewhat of a tomboy. She is often seen partaking in games with various neighborhood boys. Although her candid manner of speech often causes them to shun her, she doesn't seem to mind. In fact, she has no problem at all with forcing her way into their game. In battle, she has proven to be bull-headed and a sore loser. Like Gintoki, and probably because of his influence, she is not above resorting to petty tricks and manipulation to get the better of her adversary. Unlike many conventional manga heroines, she doesn't display the same consciousness toward decorum, table manners, and physical appearance. Puking, cussing, picking her nose, spitting, fighting, and scratching herself are common behavior for Kagura.

She regards Okita, captain of the Shinsengumi, as a rival. She detests him and appeared to be disgusted when she previously mentioned (about Okita), that ""he definitely likes me,"" but as that hasn't been brought up since, it is uncertain on if it should be considered canon, that he apparently likes her.

Although Kagura usually teases Shinpachi, she deeply cares for him and thinks of him as a brother. She also shows great respect toward his older sister, Shimura Tae, often calling her ""Anego"" (a term gangster women use to show respect).

Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu (being her 27th pet), have met with an untimely demise by her hands (with the exception of Sadaharu 28,' a beetle killed by Okita). She cuddles with Sadaharu when feeling down. Kagura also seems to be the only one (aside from Ane, Mone, and Komako) who Sadaharu listens to.

According to the OVA, Kagura is the first and only Weekly Shonen Jump girl to vomit on-screen. To date, she has induced herself to vomit on several occasions. She also has an uncanny knack for seeming calm or detached during high-tension situations; in episode 5, she slept through a car-chase. Her appetite knows no bounds, and she is especially fond of sukonbu.

In Japanese, Kagura speaks in a stereotypical dialect that is associated with Chinese immigrants. In the English-translated manga, she punctuates her sentences with yup, uh-huh (aru), nope, and the like.


In the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura meets her older brother, Kamui who abandoned her because she was weak in his eyes. During the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura and Shinpachi teamed up against a Yato veteran named Abuto. When Shinpachi was mortally wounded by Abuto, Kagura can no longer hold against her Yato blood and revealed her true inner killing instincts against Abuto. Abuto is easily overwhelmed by Kagura's true power.
In the last Gintama character popularity poll, she came in the 6th place."

Birthdate: August 12
Zodiac: Leo
Height: 166 cm
Weight: 55 kg
Age: 16

Shinpachi Shimura works under Gintoki to learn the ways of the samurai. He used to stay at his family's dōjo. However, it seems more like he's just trying to help Gintoki pay the rent than to learn. Shinpachi is the captain of the ""Otsu's Imperial Guard,"" a pop-singer's fan club.

Shinpachi meets Gintoki after Shinpachi was tripped by the ambassador of Planet Chatoran. Gintoki beats up the ambassador and his guards, not to stand up for Shinpachi, but to get revenge for his spilled parfait. Gintoki frames Shinpachi for the crime, which somehow led to him saving Shimura Tae (Otae), Shinpachi's sister, from becoming part of a brothel.

Despite his meek appearance, Shinpachi is a more than competent swordsman of his family's Kakidō-Ryu, the type of swordmanship his dojo teaches.

In the character popularity poll, he was in 8th place.

His name is roughly based on Shinsengumi member Nagakura Shinpachi and comedian Ken Shimura."

Zodiac: Taurus
Age: 27
Blood type: A
Height: 177 cm
Weight: 64 kg
Others: right-handed, chain smoker
Affiliations: Shinsengumi

Hijikata is the famed chain smoking, vice commander of the Shinsengumi so named by his subordinates, because of his fearsome demeanor. Purportedly the brains behind the force, he takes his work seriously, and is fiercely loyal to his leader, Isao Kondo.

Hijikata has a reputation as a fearsome leader, earning the nickname of ""demonic vice-commander."" He is also hot-tempered and often speaks of seppuku. However, despite his cold exterior, he does have a more compassionate side. He also has a tendency to cry after watching movies that are not particularly emotional.

Hijikata is obsessed with mayonnaise and thus has the nickname ""Mayora."" He has been known to smother anything he eats under a mountain of mayonnaise, and he carries a number of objects shaped like jars of mayonnaise, such as his cigarette lighter. He was popular with girls until they discovered this obsession.

He enjoys fighting and sees Gintoki as a rival in practically everything he does from drinking contests to rock, paper, scissors ever since being defeated by him in battle. He is in constant danger of being killed by the attempts on his life by Okita. But, despite all this, he sees Okita as one of his close friends, and vice versa.

Before joining Shinsengumi, he used to be a trouble-maker ronin. He enjoys fighting/having a good fight and says he doesn't care how many Amanto buildings get blown up, he only looks forward to having a big battle with the Joui rebels after Shinsengumi has rounded them in 1 fell swoop, in Episode 5.

He also formulated the Kyokuchuu Hatto, the 45 Regulations that form the disciplinary framework for Shinsengumi members, and implements them firmly.

Age: 18
Birthdate: July 8
Height: 170 cm
Weight: 58 kg
Occupation: First Division Captain Shinsengumi

Okita is the best swordsman in the Shinsengumi. Personality-wise, he tends to be light-hearted and somewhat childish though his speech is heavily deadpan.

He outwardly displays annoyance and dislike for Hijikata, and continuously tries to harm and humiliate him whenever given the chance.


Losing his parents at a young age, he was raised by his sister, Mitsuba. Thus, although he is sadistic and violent towards other people, Okita absolutely adores his sister and does everything he can to please her. Mitsuba is one of the reasons why Okita hates Hijikata. Okita viewed Hijikata as a rival for his sister's attention. He also greatly dislikes the fact that Hijikata treated Mitsuba coldly, although Mitsuba clearly showed signs of liking Hijikata.
Okita has great affection and fondness for Kondo, who took him under his wings when he was little. He still regards Hijikata as one of his three friends (the other two being Kondo and Gintoki).

He enjoys seeing women fight, finding the ugly looks on their faces as they grab each other being hilarious. He wears a distinctive eye mask when taking a nap during duty, which is a frequent occurrence. At one point, he refers to himself as the best sniper in the Shinsengumi. Although he is a master of kenjutsu, he uses a bazooka more often.

He also regards Kagura as a rival after an unfinished rock-paper-scissors duel during a sakura-blossom party. He states that he'll ""be the only one to defeat her"", and usually calls her ""China"".

In the original Japanese manga he likes to end his sentences in ""~desaa"" and ""~desuzee.""

In Sorachi's original character design, Okita was a female, and wielded an umbrella. This concept was ultimately given to Kagura.

In the second Shounen JUMP character popularity poll, he ranked 2nd place, just below Gintoki.

In volume 12, Okita's age is revealed to be 18. Despite being under Japan's legal drinking age, in Edo, you can drink alcohol from 15.

His name is based on the historical Okita Souji."
Katsura, Kotarou;Kotarou Katsura (桂 小太郎);"Kotarou ""Zura, Fruits Punch Samurai, Zurako, Captain Katsura, Katsuo"" Katsura";"
Age: 20s
Birthday: June 26 (Cancer)
Height: 175 cm
Weight: 56 kg
Blood Type: AB

Katsura is Gintoki's former comrade during the Joi war. Even after the Amanto take-over of Japan, Katsura continues to resist the Amanto, and has amassed a band of followers. His weapon of choice is a metallic grenade. He is a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, and is constantly on the run from the Shinsengumi. Although his initial methods were originally more violent in nature (for instance, sending a bomb to an Amanto embassy), Katsura has gradually grown to believe that there are people important to him in Edo, and decides that he no longer wants to destroy the country, but believes there should be a way to change it without causing sacrifices.

Katsura seems to be highly respected by his followers, and has even been called the ""Daybreak of the Joui Faction"" by some. When people believed that Katsura had died during the Benizakura arc, even other terrorist groups tried to avenge his death.
Since he is a wanted man, Katsura is often seen wearing disguises, although his identity is often still easily found out. One example of a disguise he seems to be fond of is a pirate's costume, complete with an eyepatch (with a skull design) over his left eye and a scar on his right cheek, and using this he calls himself 'Space Captain Katsura'.

Katsura seems to possess a rather outdated sense of humour, and sometimes refers to things from a past era, such as when he tried to buy a Famicon when people were queuing up to buy the OwEe (a parody of the Wii). He also seems to have a tendency to make up dramatic stories, which moves others to tears when they hear these stories (except Gintoki).
Katsura sometimes works odd jobs (e.g. in Episode 88), to raise money for his terrorist activities. He claims that his heart has started to be moved by Ikumatsu in episode 39 (chapter 55 equivalent of the manga), and held his subsequent interview in her ramen restaurant.

In the Japanese version, Gintoki often calls him ""Zura."" In the first English volume, Gintoki calls him ""Casserole,"" or ""Cough syrup."" Eventually, the English version changed to Gintoki calling Katsura ""Zura."" In the Japanese version, Katsura indignantly replies ""Not 'Zura'! It's Katsura!"" (and will do so anytime he is called something other than his name). In the English version he replies ""Not Casserole! It's Katsura!"" The Japanese version joke is a pun, since ""Katsura"" can mean wig in Japanese and ""Zura"" is slang for the same thing. The English version is also a wordplay since ""Katsura"" and ""Casserole"" sound somewhat similar in pronunciation. He has the uncanny ability to know when someone has called him something other than Katsura, even in their head. An example being in Episode 25 as a guest to Gintoki's hotpot dinner.

His name is based on the historical Katsura Kogoro."

Zodiac: Gemini
Height: 179 cm
Weight: 67 kg

Hasegawa used to be an official working for the Bakufu, but after an unfortunate incident with Amanto dignitary Prince Hata, whom he was assigned to serve and protect, his superior asked him to succumb to his shame and commit seppuku, hearing that he ran away from his quarters.

He initially believed that humans should focus on appeasing the Amanto, but after his encounter with Gintoki, his mindset changed, which led to him punching Hata out, thus getting fired. Since then, he has been living a life of somewhat like a loser, getting fired almost every time he gets a new job, mostly due to the unfavourable look his sunglasses and goatee give him.

No matter what, he refuses to remove his sunglasses because it's the only thing he had left to remind him of his successful past. Although he does exchange the sunglasses for a decent pair of half-moon spectacles at one point, he goes back to wearing them after he decides that he is going to live out his life in the best way he can. He is constantly seen working various part-time jobs. He is often referred to as ""Madao,"" short for ""marude damena ossan,"" which roughly translates into ""totally useless middle-aged man.""

He and Gintoki are on good terms with one another and seem to spend most of their free time gambling. He often plays pachinko, but rarely ever wins. After losing his job for the Bakufu, he is seen doing odd jobs from time to time, like running a supermarket for a friend or driving a taxi at one time.

He's currently estranged from his wife Hatsu, because of his jobless lifestyle, however they still keep in touch.

It is revealed in episode 52 that he is 38 years old after he pees his pants."

Birthday: February 9
Height: 170 cm (5' 7"")
Weight: 52 kg (114 lb)

Tsukuyo is a blonde-haired woman with a scar over her forehead and left cheek. One of the better known Hundred Blooms of Yoshiwara, a law enforcement squad of Yoshiwara that consists of all females, deployed by the Night King Hosen. Despite appearing to be a heartless person when approached by Odd Jobs when he arrives to Yoshiwara, throwing a fake kunai to their foreheads, she later becomes friends with them. She has a difficult past being orphaned as a child, only to be picked up and raised by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. While the original motive for Jiraia was to instill every bit of despair and tragedy of his own life into Tsukuyo, of who he refers to as his art or perfect creation, Tsukuyo ended up growing attached to what he did not manage to do. That is ""Friends, A Home, and Precious Things To Protect"" as told by Jiraia. Her loyalty and home lies with Hinowa in the underground city of Yoshiwara. She has ties with Hinowa, who also helped raise her like an older sister/mother through her childhood.


It is hinted by Jiraia (in Chapter 255/Episode 178) Hinowa and Seita (in Chapter 294) that she has romantic feelings for Gintoki. This is further supported by her scribbling out statements from Hinowa's and Seita's New Year's cards commenting how lonely she was when they heard Gintoki has gotten married and her inability to give him chocolates for Valentine's Day (in Episode 204). Tsukyo herself has confirmed that, while she doesn't quite know what they are or what to do with them, she has some feelings towards Gintoki. This was in episode 177 when she said to him, ""When I am with you, my resolve weakens. Don't shake up my feelings any further.""

Zodiac: Leo
Hair: Black (purple highlights)
Eyes: Light Olive Green (bandage over left eye)
Height: 170cm
Weight: 60kg
Occupation: Leader of the Kiheitai
Hobbies: Smoking a pipe, Playing a shamisen

A former comrade of Gintoki and Katsura and a major antagonist. He now leads a radical Joui faction called the Kiheitai and is known amongst the Shinsengumi as 'the most dangerous man in both the Joui faction and amongst the radicals'. He is easily recognizable through his bandaged left eye, his colorful kimono, his eerie smile, and the pipe he is often seen smoking.

He, Gintoki, and Katsura studied in the same temple elementary school when they were children, and he fought with them against the Amanto invasion during the latter part of the Joui war. After the war ended, he vanished, and has since gained a dangerous reputation due to his assassination of many of the Bakufu's main officers and his planning of a large-scale coup d'etat. Before his first appearance in both the anime and the manga, he was mentioned to have fled Edo and to have been hiding in Kyoto, although it is unclear how long before this was.

He now believes that the only way to save it is to destroy the ""rotten"" post-Joui war world.

He is shown to like festivals, although this is mainly due to the opportunity they provide for a large-scale terrorist attack: he appears to have an attraction to ruin that is almost nihilistic. He also appears to have considerable insight due to his 'seeing through Itou's heart' and subsequently planting him in the Shinsengumi's ranks.

It can be assumed that he is as skilled a swordsman as both Gintoki and Katsura, having fought alongside them as one of the 'heroes' of the Joui war. That aside, he appears to have at least considerable skill in playing the shamisen, and is shown at one point playing it with Bansai as they talk.

He is based on the historical Takasugi Shinsaku."

Killua is a member of the Zoldyck family, who are a family of legendary assassins. Since birth, he trained endlessly in the art of assassination. He eventually ran away from his family and profession out of boredom and joined the Hunter exam to pass the time. He befriended Gon almost immediately and has loyally followed his best friend since then.

Killua is usually a kind-hearted and cheerful, cheeky boy, but if provoked, he becomes extremely deadly and bloodthirsty, able to kill an enemy in seconds.

He is confident and aware of his abilities and strengths, and not afraid to speak his mind, but also smart enough to know when to hold his tongue. He can get embarrassed easily when someone compliments him or openly shows affection towards him.

He is very intelligent and quick-thinking, and skilled in analysis, particularly induction. He is able to calmly and rapidly form strategies to adapt to stressful situations.

Due to his training as an assassin, it's an ingrained habit of his to be extremely cautious when approaching a fight, often assuming the worst case scenario, so he is quicker to flee than to try to face an apparently stronger opponent. For most of the series, this is his greatest flaw. He is also a loyal friend who is selfless to a fault, and suffers greatly trying to help his friends without a single thought to his own health.

He is also from the transmutation Nen group. He constantly strives to improve his Nen ability, developing many interesting techniques as time moves on.

He is also the third person to have a transmutation Nen as his father and grandfather also are transmutation Nen users. Coincidentally, all three family members have silver hair."

Abilities: Holy Chain, Dowsing Chain, Chain Jail, Judgment Chain

Kurapika is a member of the Kurta tribe who were massacred by the Phantom Troupe (The Spiders) 4 years prior the Hunter exam. The Kurta tribe was an isolated group of people whose eyes would turn scarlet when angered or excited. These scarlet eyes were known to be beautiful, being one of the seven most beautiful in the world. Because of this, the Kurta tribe was constantly pursued and eventually massacred. The eyes of the tribe members were all taken away during the massacre. Kurapika is so far the only known survivor with a heart bent on revenge. He strives to have his revenge against the Phantom Troupe as well as recover the eyes of his tribe members.

Despite having a heart full of hatred, Kurapika is very kind and loyal towards his friends. He is an extremely intelligent person but at the same time reckless. Kurapika is from the materialization nen group and from determination, increased the power of his nen ability to the point that it was formidable against the Phantom Troupe.

Kurapika can conjure a unique weapon — five chains that extend from each finger on his right hand. Some of the fingers were specially designed to deal vengeance on the Phantom Troupe. To increase his effectiveness against the formidable Phantom Troupe, Kurapika places strict Limitations on the usage of his chains. The purpose of the chain on Kurapika's index finger has yet to be revealed.

Kurapika's Techniques

Holy Chain (癒す親指の鎖 ホーリーチェーン The Healing Thumb Chain): Type Conjuration and Enhancement
Shaped like a cross, it cures wounds by drawing from Enhancement abilities. When Kurapika is in his Specialist state, its ability is Enhanced and can heal serious injuries within seconds.
Chain Jail (束縛する中指の鎖 チェーンジェイル The Restraining Middle Finger Chain): Type Conjuration, Emission, and Manipulation
Shaped like a hook, it wraps around Spiders and restricts their movement. Also forcefully causes its prisoners to enter Zetsu, shutting off their aura and preventing the use of Nen abilities. Escape from the Chain Jail is only possible through brute force. Kurapika imposed a limitation onto this chain, it can only be used to deal with members of the Phantom Troupe. If this condition is violated, Kurapika will die. This condition was needed in order to increase the strength of the ability.
Dowsing Chain (導く薬指の鎖 ダウジングチェーン The Guiding Ring Finger Chain): Type Conjuration
Shaped like a ball and chain, Kurapika uses this frequently under normal situations, for defensive and offensive purposes. It is also useful for other investigative activities, like determining the location of missing individuals. He also uses this chain to identify if someone is lying. It has a small ball-like weight at the end which moves in the direction of whatever he is dowsing for.
Judgment Chain (律する小指の鎖 ジャッジメントチェーン The Arbiter Little Finger Chain): Type Conjuration, Emission, and Manipulation
​The Stake of Retribution, a blade on the end of the Judgment Chain, enters the victim's body and wraps around the heart. Kurapika sets two conditions and if the victim violates either one, the chain crushes the heart, killing them. It can only be used while Kurapika's eyes are scarlet. Kurapika himself has a blade wrapped around his heart, which he used to set the conditions of use for his Chain Jail ability.
Emperor Time (絶対時間 エンペラータイム Absolute Mastery): Type Specialization
When Kurapika's eyes shift into scarlet, he changes from a Conjurer to a Specialist. This ability allows him to utilize all the types of Nen to 100% efficiency (for a Conjurer). In the manga, Kurapika explains this using the terms ""Level"" and ""Force/Accuracy"". Kurapika's ""Levels"" in the various Nen categories remain the same during Emperor Time, however, his Force and Accuracy for every category is raised to 100%. Thus, if Kurapika's Level in Conjuration were 10, his Level in Emission (the polar opposite aura type) would be 4, and during Emperor Time, he would be evenly matched against a Level 4 Emitter at 100%. Outside of Emperor Time, his Force and Accuracy in Emission would at most be only be 40%."

His main goal was to fight their leader, Chrollo, but his membership proved to be a farce, because he would never appear without other Troupe members, and rarely at that.

Meruem;Meruem  (メルエム);"Meruem ""The King, The Chimera Ant King"" ";"
The chimera ant King, Meruem is the most powerful offspring of the chimera ant Queen.


Meruem is first seen when he violently rips through the womb of the chimera ant Queen from the inside, ready to emerge into the world and unwilling to wait for a natural birth. Shortly after his birth, Meruem leaves the hive and NGL with the Royal Guards, in search of a place to start his kingdom. He descends on the Republic of East Gorteau and takes over over the country by killing its dictator, Ming Jol-ik. Meruem then uses Jol-ik's corpse as a puppet to order East Gorteau's population of approximately five million to gather simultaneously in the capital city for a national rally. This however, is a ruse, designed to create a situation where entire towns and villages could be secretly abducted for a ""selection"", the forcible awakening of nen, without their disappearance being noticed. Meruem's eventual plan was to take the one percent of the population that would survive such an awakening and turn them into soldiers for an army he will use to conquer the world. This plan is temporarily disrupted by Killua, who assassinates a number of ""selectors"", but a backup plan is soon implemented; East Gorteau is put under martial law, and the population undergo selection in their own homes, though this slows down the process considerably, and only 500,000 people are processed, with 5,000 predicted survivors. Soon after this occurs, the Hunters Netero, Morau, Knuckle, Shoot, Killua, and Gon attack the palace, with the intention of separating the Royal Guards from Meruem and assassinating him. Meruem's initial personality, when he his first shown in the story, is that of arrogance. The Queen's intention to give birth to a perfect offspring is reflected in Meruem's mentality. He considered himself superior to all other forms of life and felt no concern for his dying mother after his ""birth."" Meruem was also merciless, instantly killing any chimera ant he considered disrespectful. Meruem was seen killing and eating other chimera ants, something no other chimera ant had ever done. After reaching East Gorteau and putting his plans into motion, Meruem took an interest in various board games, and gathered various champion-level players to his palace. Simply by reading the rule books, Meruem was able to master any game in under ten matches, simultaneously learning from his opponents while disrupting the ""flow"" of their play style. After defeating the best player for each game, Meruem proceeded to kill them, as they were of no further use to him. The final game Meruem learns is Gungi, a fictional shogi-like board game invented by East Gorteau. The world champion for the game is Komugi, a seemingly dimwitted blind girl; However, as Meruem played against her, he found himself unable to disrupt her flow, while at the same time, the challenge of playing against Meruem caused Komugi's skills to increase. Much to the shock of the Royal Guards, Meruem even starts show respect for Komugi and concern for Komugi's well being. In one instance Meruem rips his left arm off, as an apology to Komugi for asking her to bet her left arm on a game, to which she replied that she always bet her life. In another instance, after watching Komugi's nen suddenly awaken, and realizing she would grow exponentially stronger, but only in terms of Gungi, Meruem momentarily decides that his power of ""violence"" was the strongest type of strength, and ultimately Komugi's abilities are meaningless; Yet, moments after this decision, Meruem finds Komugi under attack by a large bird of prey, and is unable to bring himself to do anything except protect her, ultimately unable to understand his own emotions toward Komugi. This leaves Meruem in a contemplative state, wondering about the purpose for his existence in the world. As of chapter 290 of the manga, Meruem is preparing to battle Netero, who attacked his castle in order to assassinate him. Before the battle, Komugi is gravely injured by a nen ability meant to cause confusion within the palace, and Meruem orders Nefelpitou to save her life. The way Meruem is drawn in this scene suggests he has learned what it means to have concern for someone else's well being. He and Netero then travel to a remote location that was once used for military weapons testing, so that they may both go all out in their fight. However, in a surprising twist, Meruem refuses to fight the Hunter. Through a short conversation between the two, the King reveals that he finally realizes that he should use his power to protect the weak, seeing from Komugi that there are humans who deserve to live; Netero counted among them. He also expresses a desire to remake the world so that everyone is so equal, the term ""equality"" would become obsolete. Netero realizes that Meruem is dangerously caught between his Ant instincts and his humanity, and at this point, either facet of his psyche could win out. Knowing that he has a mission to carry out regardless, and not wanting his heart to waver, Netero suddenly assaults Meruem first with a devastating attack. Meruem possesses a nen ability that allows him to absorb the raw aura of nen-users he has killed. By devouring their brain, he adds their aura to his own--further increasing his power. His fighting ability is such that even Netero, chairman of the Hunter committee, expresses doubt that he could defeat him.

Neferpitou;Neferpitou  (ネフェルピトー );"Neferpitou ""Pitou"" ";"
Neferpitou is a cat-humanoid Chimera Ant and the firstborn of the Chimera Ant King's three Royal Guards.

They are very loyal to the King, just like the rest of the Royal Guards and would sacrifice themselves for him. Neferpitou gets distracted easily, loves to play a lot and that makes them the most curious of the three Royal Guards. Hence their cat-like appearance, Pitou is a cat Chimera Ant who loves to play with their opponents like a cat would with their prey. Despite their cheerful and playful manner, Pitou has a sadistic and terrifying personality as well.

Unlike Menthuthuyoupi and Shaiapouf, Neferpitou does not seem to mind much in regards to Meruem's later newfound interests with Komugi. Thus, among the three Royal Guards, Neferpitou is the only one that greatly prioritizes Komugi's safety as opposed to how Menthuthuyoupi and Shaiapouf hate Komugi, something Neferpitou is aware of which creates distrust in regards to the matter, for making their king deviate from the path they envision for him.

None other than the Chairman of the Hunter Committee, and the final authority over the entirety of the Hunter Exam. He has enough administrative power to grant anyone the Hunter's license if he decides to do so, and enough combat power to playfully avoid attacks of the main heroes single-handedly when they challenge him. All examiners, even the most despotic ones, obey his orders without talking back.

He was said to be the strongest Nen user in the world 50 years ago, but he comments that he is already past his prime at his current age and that his subordinates might be stronger than him now (yet his direct subordinates disagree). Netero is also revealed to be older than Zeno Zaoldyeck (Killua's Grandfather), who is said to be 67 years of age. At one point, Zeno says that when he was still a young boy, Netero was not only already old, but he is the only person alive who has fought with Maha (Zeno's) grandfather. Various stated times would put Netero over the three digit mark.He is able to use attacks faster than the speed of sound. His ability is known as 'Hyakushiki Kannon', or the '100-type Guanyin Bodhisattva'. This utilizes nen to make the attacks seem as if they had come from another side and or dimension, simply because they move so fast.


In the Chimera Ant Arc, he is also shown fighting chimera ants and is heading towards the destined fight with the King. His assistants Morau and Novu note that he was the strongest Nen user 50 years ago, and show great respect for his abilities.

Then, all of the damage that he has received in battle into scorching heat (named ""Rising Sun"") and is emitted into the air.

""Then and now, what I protect has never changed.""
Occupation: Yorozuya/Odd Jobs

Gintoki is a samurai living in an era when samurai are no longer needed. To add to his troubles, oppressive aliens have moved in to invade planet Earth. Gintoki works taking on odd jobs alongside two kids: Kagura and Shinpachi. In the Joui war, he was known as the ""White Devil"" (Shiroyasha) due to his silver hair and white clothing he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear in the hearts of the Amanto.

Gintoki has naturally permed silver hair, which he blames for his lacking love-life. He has a big crush on the TV's news weather girl, Ketsuno. In fact, to date, the only time he is seen to have blushed is when he tries to make use of Sadaharu and Ketsuno's dog to get a chance to talk to her.(Though he later does with Tsukuyo as well when she discovers him shopping) Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response and merely puts up with them as annoyances.

Gintoki has two major obsessions in life. He is obsessed with sweet food such as parfaits, ice cream and cakes. His second obsession is reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Shounen Jump. (Which, not coincidentally, is where Gintama is published). Gintoki will go to great lengths to get the latest Jump issue, to the point of reckless behavior. His Jump obsession makes him dream of being like other Jump heroes, including wishing that he had a ""Bankai"" similar to the characters of Bleach.

Despite his appearance and initial behavior, Gintoki has a great amount of pride for the old bushido code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he's barely acquainted with, be it a pit-fighter who was taking care of abandoned orphans or an Amanto who resembles a kappa.

Despite being a fearsome fighter with nearly unmatched skills, he avoids needless bloodshed after suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joui war.

Kagura;Kagura  (神楽);"Kagura ""Gura, China Girl, Leader, Gurako"" ";"
Age: 14
Birthday: November 3
Zodiac: Scorpio
Height: 155 cm
Weight: 40 kg

Kagura, meaning ""god-entertainment"" is a member of the Yorozuya alongside Sakata Gintoki and Shinpachi Shimura and the main female protagonist of Gintama.

Although she appears to be a normal, cute, human girl in Chinese-style clothing, she actually belongs to the Yato Clan, one of the strongest and most bloodthirsty of the Amanto races. The Yato people are said to have ""transparent"" skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan's weapon of choice; Kagura's is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motor-scooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise by her hands.

She is also extremely flexible and fast; capable of catching multiple speeding bullets between her teeth and fingers. During battle, she's often seen flipping through the air and performing various acrobatic feats. Due to her Yato blood, she is capable of rapid regeneration. During the Benizakura arc, she is seen healing from a gunshot wound almost overnight.

Kagura also has an unusually strong appetite. She is able to consume large quantities of food within a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, her tastes are endearingly plain. Sukonbu, rice, and eggs are among her favorite foods.

Her immediate family consists of her father, Umibouzu, a widely recognized alien hunter, her mother, who is deceased, and her older brother Kamui, once presumed missing who is now involved with the space pirates Harusame.

She came to Earth to earn money for her family. She found work fighting for a gang, but when they ordered her to kill her target, she ran away. Not long afterward, she met Gintoki and Shinpachi when Gintoki accidentally ran her down with his scooter. After they helped her to make a clean break from the gang, she intimidated Gintoki into hiring her. She now lives at the Yorozuya and sleeps in Gintoki's closet, like Doraemon.

Kagura and Gintoki share an odd brother-younger sister-like relationship. Together with Shinpachi, the three of them makes for a strange, dysfunctional, yet tightly knit family. Kagura is very protective of Gintoki. Although she herself has gotten into many fights with him, she rarely lets anyone else pick on him. She seems to trust wholeheartedly in Gintoki's ability and strength. Even in sticky situations, she has no doubt that Gin-chan would come and save her. She has a tendency to imitate Gintoki's bad habits (like picking her nose or swearing, hence her unladylike behavior) and would often quote the bad advice he gives her. Some of her lines start with ""Gin-chan says..."" or ""Gin-chan told me...""

Kagura is also somewhat of a tomboy. She is often seen partaking in games with various neighborhood boys. Although her candid manner of speech often causes them to shun her, she doesn't seem to mind. In fact, she has no problem at all with forcing her way into their game. In battle, she has proven to be bull-headed and a sore loser. Like Gintoki, and probably because of his influence, she is not above resorting to petty tricks and manipulation to get the better of her adversary. Unlike many conventional manga heroines, she doesn't display the same consciousness toward decorum, table manners, and physical appearance. Puking, cussing, picking her nose, spitting, fighting, and scratching herself are common behavior for Kagura.

She regards Okita, captain of the Shinsengumi, as a rival. She detests him and appeared to be disgusted when she previously mentioned (about Okita), that ""he definitely likes me,"" but as that hasn't been brought up since, it is uncertain on if it should be considered canon, that he apparently likes her.

Although Kagura usually teases Shinpachi, she deeply cares for him and thinks of him as a brother. She also shows great respect toward his older sister, Shimura Tae, often calling her ""Anego"" (a term gangster women use to show respect).

Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu (being her 27th pet), have met with an untimely demise by her hands (with the exception of Sadaharu 28,' a beetle killed by Okita). She cuddles with Sadaharu when feeling down. Kagura also seems to be the only one (aside from Ane, Mone, and Komako) who Sadaharu listens to.

According to the OVA, Kagura is the first and only Weekly Shonen Jump girl to vomit on-screen. To date, she has induced herself to vomit on several occasions. She also has an uncanny knack for seeming calm or detached during high-tension situations; in episode 5, she slept through a car-chase. Her appetite knows no bounds, and she is especially fond of sukonbu.

In Japanese, Kagura speaks in a stereotypical dialect that is associated with Chinese immigrants. In the English-translated manga, she punctuates her sentences with yup, uh-huh (aru), nope, and the like.


In the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura meets her older brother, Kamui who abandoned her because she was weak in his eyes. During the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura and Shinpachi teamed up against a Yato veteran named Abuto. When Shinpachi was mortally wounded by Abuto, Kagura can no longer hold against her Yato blood and revealed her true inner killing instincts against Abuto. Abuto is easily overwhelmed by Kagura's true power.
In the last Gintama character popularity poll, she came in the 6th place."

Weight: 55 kg
Age: 16

Shinpachi Shimura works under Gintoki to learn the ways of the samurai. He used to stay at his family's dōjo. However, it seems more like he's just trying to help Gintoki pay the rent than to learn. Shinpachi is the captain of the ""Otsu's Imperial Guard,"" a pop-singer's fan club.

Shinpachi meets Gintoki after Shinpachi was tripped by the ambassador of Planet Chatoran. Gintoki beats up the ambassador and his guards, not to stand up for Shinpachi, but to get revenge for his spilled parfait. Gintoki frames Shinpachi for the crime, which somehow led to him saving Shimura Tae (Otae), Shinpachi's sister, from becoming part of a brothel.

Despite his meek appearance, Shinpachi is a more than competent swordsman of his family's Kakidō-Ryu, the type of swordmanship his dojo teaches.

In the character popularity poll, he was in 8th place.

His name is roughly based on Shinsengumi member Nagakura Shinpachi and comedian Ken Shimura."

Zodiac: Taurus
Age: 27
Blood type: A
Height: 177 cm
Weight: 64 kg
Others: right-handed, chain smoker
Affiliations: Shinsengumi

Hijikata is the famed chain smoking, vice commander of the Shinsengumi so named by his subordinates, because of his fearsome demeanor. Purportedly the brains behind the force, he takes his work seriously, and is fiercely loyal to his leader, Isao Kondo.

Hijikata has a reputation as a fearsome leader, earning the nickname of ""demonic vice-commander."" He is also hot-tempered and often speaks of seppuku. However, despite his cold exterior, he does have a more compassionate side. He also has a tendency to cry after watching movies that are not particularly emotional.

Hijikata is obsessed with mayonnaise and thus has the nickname ""Mayora."" He has been known to smother anything he eats under a mountain of mayonnaise, and he carries a number of objects shaped like jars of mayonnaise, such as his cigarette lighter. He was popular with girls until they discovered this obsession.

He enjoys fighting and sees Gintoki as a rival in practically everything he does from drinking contests to rock, paper, scissors ever since being defeated by him in battle. He is in constant danger of being killed by the attempts on his life by Okita. But, despite all this, he sees Okita as one of his close friends, and vice versa.

Before joining Shinsengumi, he used to be a trouble-maker ronin. He enjoys fighting/having a good fight and says he doesn't care how many Amanto buildings get blown up, he only looks forward to having a big battle with the Joui rebels after Shinsengumi has rounded them in 1 fell swoop, in Episode 5.

He also formulated the Kyokuchuu Hatto, the 45 Regulations that form the disciplinary framework for Shinsengumi members, and implements them firmly.

Weight: 58 kg
Occupation: First Division Captain Shinsengumi

Okita is the best swordsman in the Shinsengumi. Personality-wise, he tends to be light-hearted and somewhat childish though his speech is heavily deadpan.

He outwardly displays annoyance and dislike for Hijikata, and continuously tries to harm and humiliate him whenever given the chance.


Losing his parents at a young age, he was raised by his sister, Mitsuba. Thus, although he is sadistic and violent towards other people, Okita absolutely adores his sister and does everything he can to please her. Mitsuba is one of the reasons why Okita hates Hijikata. Okita viewed Hijikata as a rival for his sister's attention. He also greatly dislikes the fact that Hijikata treated Mitsuba coldly, although Mitsuba clearly showed signs of liking Hijikata.
Okita has great affection and fondness for Kondo, who took him under his wings when he was little. He still regards Hijikata as one of his three friends (the other two being Kondo and Gintoki).

He enjoys seeing women fight, finding the ugly looks on their faces as they grab each other being hilarious. He wears a distinctive eye mask when taking a nap during duty, which is a frequent occurrence. At one point, he refers to himself as the best sniper in the Shinsengumi. Although he is a master of kenjutsu, he uses a bazooka more often.

He also regards Kagura as a rival after an unfinished rock-paper-scissors duel during a sakura-blossom party. He states that he'll ""be the only one to defeat her"", and usually calls her ""China"".

In the original Japanese manga he likes to end his sentences in ""~desaa"" and ""~desuzee.""

In Sorachi's original character design, Okita was a female, and wielded an umbrella. This concept was ultimately given to Kagura.

In the second Shounen JUMP character popularity poll, he ranked 2nd place, just below Gintoki.

In volume 12, Okita's age is revealed to be 18. Despite being under Japan's legal drinking age, in Edo, you can drink alcohol from 15.

His name is based on the historical Okita Souji."

Age: 20s
Birthday: June 26 (Cancer)
Height: 175 cm
Weight: 56 kg
Blood Type: AB

Katsura is Gintoki's former comrade during the Joi war. Even after the Amanto take-over of Japan, Katsura continues to resist the Amanto, and has amassed a band of followers. His weapon of choice is a metallic grenade. He is a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, and is constantly on the run from the Shinsengumi. Although his initial methods were originally more violent in nature (for instance, sending a bomb to an Amanto embassy), Katsura has gradually grown to believe that there are people important to him in Edo, and decides that he no longer wants to destroy the country, but believes there should be a way to change it without causing sacrifices.

Katsura seems to be highly respected by his followers, and has even been called the ""Daybreak of the Joui Faction"" by some. When people believed that Katsura had died during the Benizakura arc, even other terrorist groups tried to avenge his death.
Since he is a wanted man, Katsura is often seen wearing disguises, although his identity is often still easily found out. One example of a disguise he seems to be fond of is a pirate's costume, complete with an eyepatch (with a skull design) over his left eye and a scar on his right cheek, and using this he calls himself 'Space Captain Katsura'.

Katsura seems to possess a rather outdated sense of humour, and sometimes refers to things from a past era, such as when he tried to buy a Famicon when people were queuing up to buy the OwEe (a parody of the Wii). He also seems to have a tendency to make up dramatic stories, which moves others to tears when they hear these stories (except Gintoki).
Katsura sometimes works odd jobs (e.g. in Episode 88), to raise money for his terrorist activities. He claims that his heart has started to be moved by Ikumatsu in episode 39 (chapter 55 equivalent of the manga), and held his subsequent interview in her ramen restaurant.

In the Japanese version, Gintoki often calls him ""Zura."" In the first English volume, Gintoki calls him ""Casserole,"" or ""Cough syrup."" Eventually, the English version changed to Gintoki calling Katsura ""Zura."" In the Japanese version, Katsura indignantly replies ""Not 'Zura'! It's Katsura!"" (and will do so anytime he is called something other than his name). In the English version he replies ""Not Casserole! It's Katsura!"" The Japanese version joke is a pun, since ""Katsura"" can mean wig in Japanese and ""Zura"" is slang for the same thing. The English version is also a wordplay since ""Katsura"" and ""Casserole"" sound somewhat similar in pronunciation. He has the uncanny ability to know when someone has called him something other than Katsura, even in their head. An example being in Episode 25 as a guest to Gintoki's hotpot dinner.

His name is based on the historical Katsura Kogoro."

Hasegawa used to be an official working for the Bakufu, but after an unfortunate incident with Amanto dignitary Prince Hata, whom he was assigned to serve and protect, his superior asked him to succumb to his shame and commit seppuku, hearing that he ran away from his quarters.

He initially believed that humans should focus on appeasing the Amanto, but after his encounter with Gintoki, his mindset changed, which led to him punching Hata out, thus getting fired. Since then, he has been living a life of somewhat like a loser, getting fired almost every time he gets a new job, mostly due to the unfavourable look his sunglasses and goatee give him.

No matter what, he refuses to remove his sunglasses because it's the only thing he had left to remind him of his successful past. Although he does exchange the sunglasses for a decent pair of half-moon spectacles at one point, he goes back to wearing them after he decides that he is going to live out his life in the best way he can. He is constantly seen working various part-time jobs. He is often referred to as ""Madao,"" short for ""marude damena ossan,"" which roughly translates into ""totally useless middle-aged man.""

He and Gintoki are on good terms with one another and seem to spend most of their free time gambling. He often plays pachinko, but rarely ever wins. After losing his job for the Bakufu, he is seen doing odd jobs from time to time, like running a supermarket for a friend or driving a taxi at one time.

He's currently estranged from his wife Hatsu, because of his jobless lifestyle, however they still keep in touch.

It is revealed in episode 52 that he is 38 years old after he pees his pants."
Tsukuyo;Tsukuyo  (月詠);"Tsukuyo ""Tsukki, The Moon of Yoshiwara, Shinigami Tayuu"" ";"
Birthday: February 9
Height: 170 cm (5' 7"")
Weight: 52 kg (114 lb)

Tsukuyo is a blonde-haired woman with a scar over her forehead and left cheek. One of the better known Hundred Blooms of Yoshiwara, a law enforcement squad of Yoshiwara that consists of all females, deployed by the Night King Hosen. Despite appearing to be a heartless person when approached by Odd Jobs when he arrives to Yoshiwara, throwing a fake kunai to their foreheads, she later becomes friends with them. She has a difficult past being orphaned as a child, only to be picked up and raised by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. While the original motive for Jiraia was to instill every bit of despair and tragedy of his own life into Tsukuyo, of who he refers to as his art or perfect creation, Tsukuyo ended up growing attached to what he did not manage to do. That is ""Friends, A Home, and Precious Things To Protect"" as told by Jiraia. Her loyalty and home lies with Hinowa in the underground city of Yoshiwara. She has ties with Hinowa, who also helped raise her like an older sister/mother through her childhood.


It is hinted by Jiraia (in Chapter 255/Episode 178) Hinowa and Seita (in Chapter 294) that she has romantic feelings for Gintoki. This is further supported by her scribbling out statements from Hinowa's and Seita's New Year's cards commenting how lonely she was when they heard Gintoki has gotten married and her inability to give him chocolates for Valentine's Day (in Episode 204). Tsukyo herself has confirmed that, while she doesn't quite know what they are or what to do with them, she has some feelings towards Gintoki. This was in episode 177 when she said to him, ""When I am with you, my resolve weakens. Don't shake up my feelings any further.""

Hair: Black (purple highlights)
Eyes: Light Olive Green (bandage over left eye)
Height: 170cm
Weight: 60kg
Occupation: Leader of the Kiheitai
Hobbies: Smoking a pipe, Playing a shamisen

A former comrade of Gintoki and Katsura and a major antagonist. He now leads a radical Joui faction called the Kiheitai and is known amongst the Shinsengumi as 'the most dangerous man in both the Joui faction and amongst the radicals'. He is easily recognizable through his bandaged left eye, his colorful kimono, his eerie smile, and the pipe he is often seen smoking.

He, Gintoki, and Katsura studied in the same temple elementary school when they were children, and he fought with them against the Amanto invasion during the latter part of the Joui war. After the war ended, he vanished, and has since gained a dangerous reputation due to his assassination of many of the Bakufu's main officers and his planning of a large-scale coup d'etat. Before his first appearance in both the anime and the manga, he was mentioned to have fled Edo and to have been hiding in Kyoto, although it is unclear how long before this was.

He now believes that the only way to save it is to destroy the ""rotten"" post-Joui war world.

He is shown to like festivals, although this is mainly due to the opportunity they provide for a large-scale terrorist attack: he appears to have an attraction to ruin that is almost nihilistic. He also appears to have considerable insight due to his 'seeing through Itou's heart' and subsequently planting him in the Shinsengumi's ranks.

It can be assumed that he is as skilled a swordsman as both Gintoki and Katsura, having fought alongside them as one of the 'heroes' of the Joui war. That aside, he appears to have at least considerable skill in playing the shamisen, and is shown at one point playing it with Bansai as they talk.

He is based on the historical Takasugi Shinsaku."
Elizabeth;Elizabeth  (エリザベス, 江蓮);"Elizabeth ""Eli, Shogun Ehou, Eren"" ";"
Elizabeth resembles a giant white duck or a giant penguin and is Katsura's companion. Elizabeth was a present from Tatsuma Sakamoto, who presumably picked it up on his travels around space. Although many people consider Elizabeth to be insane and extraneous, Katsura has named the ambiguous avian ""Elizabeth"" and dotes on it. Once in episode 18 Shinpachi purchased a doll named as Space Alien Stefan (宇宙怪獣ステファン) to which looks perfectly similar to Elizabeth. Elizabeth is something of a painter, and is surprisingly dexterous. Also, Elizabeth resorts to using signboards to ""communicate,"" as well as an occasional means of attack. Elizabeth is also a skilled fighter, able to use signboards to fight off swordsmen.

Although the true identity of Elizabeth is uncertain, it appears to be a man wearing a duck costume. In its first appearance, hairy legs are seen underneath her sheet and the body of a humanoid with glowing eyes is revealed as her mouth is opened just as it fell during another battle between Gintoki and Katsura. Although Katsura seems shocked at what she really is, she has subsequently remained by his side. Episode 50 implies that the person inside Elizabeth is most likely the director (Gintoki was interrupted before he can finish being cut off at ""Kanto-"" (""Direc-""). Most of the characters seem to ignore this, or at least do not give it much thought, given at the episode was completely filler. Moreover, the next time the inside of Elizabeth is shown, it reverts to the glowing eyes.

When Shinpachi boards Takasugi's ship in order to rescue Kagura, a bazooka is seen coming out of Elizabeth's mouth when she blasts the ship to distract everyone from Shinpachi. Because of this, Shinpachi refers to her as Elizabeth-senpai.

Elizabeth's birthday is September 7. ""Her"" height is 180 centimeters, and ""she"" weighs 123 kilograms.

Gintoki is a samurai living in an era when samurai are no longer needed. To add to his troubles, oppressive aliens have moved in to invade planet Earth. Gintoki works taking on odd jobs alongside two kids: Kagura and Shinpachi. In the Joui war, he was known as the ""White Devil"" (Shiroyasha) due to his silver hair and white clothing he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear in the hearts of the Amanto.

Gintoki has naturally permed silver hair, which he blames for his lacking love-life. He has a big crush on the TV's news weather girl, Ketsuno. In fact, to date, the only time he is seen to have blushed is when he tries to make use of Sadaharu and Ketsuno's dog to get a chance to talk to her.(Though he later does with Tsukuyo as well when she discovers him shopping) Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response and merely puts up with them as annoyances.

Gintoki has two major obsessions in life. He is obsessed with sweet food such as parfaits, ice cream and cakes. His second obsession is reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Shounen Jump. (Which, not coincidentally, is where Gintama is published). Gintoki will go to great lengths to get the latest Jump issue, to the point of reckless behavior. His Jump obsession makes him dream of being like other Jump heroes, including wishing that he had a ""Bankai"" similar to the characters of Bleach.

Despite his appearance and initial behavior, Gintoki has a great amount of pride for the old bushido code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he's barely acquainted with, be it a pit-fighter who was taking care of abandoned orphans or an Amanto who resembles a kappa.

Despite being a fearsome fighter with nearly unmatched skills, he avoids needless bloodshed after suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joui war.

Kagura;Kagura  (神楽);"Kagura ""Gura, China Girl, Leader, Gurako"" ";"
Age: 14
Birthday: November 3
Zodiac: Scorpio
Height: 155 cm
Weight: 40 kg

Kagura, meaning ""god-entertainment"" is a member of the Yorozuya alongside Sakata Gintoki and Shinpachi Shimura and the main female protagonist of Gintama.

Although she appears to be a normal, cute, human girl in Chinese-style clothing, she actually belongs to the Yato Clan, one of the strongest and most bloodthirsty of the Amanto races. The Yato people are said to have ""transparent"" skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan's weapon of choice; Kagura's is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motor-scooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise by her hands.

She is also extremely flexible and fast; capable of catching multiple speeding bullets between her teeth and fingers. During battle, she's often seen flipping through the air and performing various acrobatic feats. Due to her Yato blood, she is capable of rapid regeneration. During the Benizakura arc, she is seen healing from a gunshot wound almost overnight.

Kagura also has an unusually strong appetite. She is able to consume large quantities of food within a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, her tastes are endearingly plain. Sukonbu, rice, and eggs are among her favorite foods.

Her immediate family consists of her father, Umibouzu, a widely recognized alien hunter, her mother, who is deceased, and her older brother Kamui, once presumed missing who is now involved with the space pirates Harusame.

She came to Earth to earn money for her family. She found work fighting for a gang, but when they ordered her to kill her target, she ran away. Not long afterward, she met Gintoki and Shinpachi when Gintoki accidentally ran her down with his scooter. After they helped her to make a clean break from the gang, she intimidated Gintoki into hiring her. She now lives at the Yorozuya and sleeps in Gintoki's closet, like Doraemon.

Kagura and Gintoki share an odd brother-younger sister-like relationship. Together with Shinpachi, the three of them makes for a strange, dysfunctional, yet tightly knit family. Kagura is very protective of Gintoki. Although she herself has gotten into many fights with him, she rarely lets anyone else pick on him. She seems to trust wholeheartedly in Gintoki's ability and strength. Even in sticky situations, she has no doubt that Gin-chan would come and save her. She has a tendency to imitate Gintoki's bad habits (like picking her nose or swearing, hence her unladylike behavior) and would often quote the bad advice he gives her. Some of her lines start with ""Gin-chan says..."" or ""Gin-chan told me...""

Kagura is also somewhat of a tomboy. She is often seen partaking in games with various neighborhood boys. Although her candid manner of speech often causes them to shun her, she doesn't seem to mind. In fact, she has no problem at all with forcing her way into their game. In battle, she has proven to be bull-headed and a sore loser. Like Gintoki, and probably because of his influence, she is not above resorting to petty tricks and manipulation to get the better of her adversary. Unlike many conventional manga heroines, she doesn't display the same consciousness toward decorum, table manners, and physical appearance. Puking, cussing, picking her nose, spitting, fighting, and scratching herself are common behavior for Kagura.

She regards Okita, captain of the Shinsengumi, as a rival. She detests him and appeared to be disgusted when she previously mentioned (about Okita), that ""he definitely likes me,"" but as that hasn't been brought up since, it is uncertain on if it should be considered canon, that he apparently likes her.

Although Kagura usually teases Shinpachi, she deeply cares for him and thinks of him as a brother. She also shows great respect toward his older sister, Shimura Tae, often calling her ""Anego"" (a term gangster women use to show respect).

Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu (being her 27th pet), have met with an untimely demise by her hands (with the exception of Sadaharu 28,' a beetle killed by Okita). She cuddles with Sadaharu when feeling down. Kagura also seems to be the only one (aside from Ane, Mone, and Komako) who Sadaharu listens to.

According to the OVA, Kagura is the first and only Weekly Shonen Jump girl to vomit on-screen. To date, she has induced herself to vomit on several occasions. She also has an uncanny knack for seeming calm or detached during high-tension situations; in episode 5, she slept through a car-chase. Her appetite knows no bounds, and she is especially fond of sukonbu.

In Japanese, Kagura speaks in a stereotypical dialect that is associated with Chinese immigrants. In the English-translated manga, she punctuates her sentences with yup, uh-huh (aru), nope, and the like.


In the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura meets her older brother, Kamui who abandoned her because she was weak in his eyes. During the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura and Shinpachi teamed up against a Yato veteran named Abuto. When Shinpachi was mortally wounded by Abuto, Kagura can no longer hold against her Yato blood and revealed her true inner killing instincts against Abuto. Abuto is easily overwhelmed by Kagura's true power.
In the last Gintama character popularity poll, she came in the 6th place."
Shimura, Shinpachi;Shinpachi Shimura (志村新八);"Shinpachi ""Shin-chan, Shin, Pattsuan, Megane, Pachie, Shintank, Watson, Pasta"" Shimura";"
Birthdate: August 12
Zodiac: Leo
Height: 166 cm
Weight: 55 kg
Age: 16

Shinpachi Shimura works under Gintoki to learn the ways of the samurai. He used to stay at his family's dōjo. However, it seems more like he's just trying to help Gintoki pay the rent than to learn. Shinpachi is the captain of the ""Otsu's Imperial Guard,"" a pop-singer's fan club.

Shinpachi meets Gintoki after Shinpachi was tripped by the ambassador of Planet Chatoran. Gintoki beats up the ambassador and his guards, not to stand up for Shinpachi, but to get revenge for his spilled parfait. Gintoki frames Shinpachi for the crime, which somehow led to him saving Shimura Tae (Otae), Shinpachi's sister, from becoming part of a brothel.

Despite his meek appearance, Shinpachi is a more than competent swordsman of his family's Kakidō-Ryu, the type of swordmanship his dojo teaches.

In the character popularity poll, he was in 8th place.

His name is roughly based on Shinsengumi member Nagakura Shinpachi and comedian Ken Shimura."
Hijikata, Toushirou;Toushirou Hijikata (土方 十四郎);"Toushirou ""Mayora, Demonic Vice-Commander, Toshi, Thorny"" Hijikata";"
Species: human
Gender: male
Birthday: May 5 (Children's Day in Japan)
Zodiac: Taurus
Age: 27
Blood type: A
Height: 177 cm
Weight: 64 kg
Others: right-handed, chain smoker
Affiliations: Shinsengumi

Hijikata is the famed chain smoking, vice commander of the Shinsengumi so named by his subordinates, because of his fearsome demeanor. Purportedly the brains behind the force, he takes his work seriously, and is fiercely loyal to his leader, Isao Kondo.

Hijikata has a reputation as a fearsome leader, earning the nickname of ""demonic vice-commander."" He is also hot-tempered and often speaks of seppuku. However, despite his cold exterior, he does have a more compassionate side. He also has a tendency to cry after watching movies that are not particularly emotional.

Hijikata is obsessed with mayonnaise and thus has the nickname ""Mayora."" He has been known to smother anything he eats under a mountain of mayonnaise, and he carries a number of objects shaped like jars of mayonnaise, such as his cigarette lighter. He was popular with girls until they discovered this obsession.

He enjoys fighting and sees Gintoki as a rival in practically everything he does from drinking contests to rock, paper, scissors ever since being defeated by him in battle. He is in constant danger of being killed by the attempts on his life by Okita. But, despite all this, he sees Okita as one of his close friends, and vice versa.

Before joining Shinsengumi, he used to be a trouble-maker ronin. He enjoys fighting/having a good fight and says he doesn't care how many Amanto buildings get blown up, he only looks forward to having a big battle with the Joui rebels after Shinsengumi has rounded them in 1 fell swoop, in Episode 5.

He also formulated the Kyokuchuu Hatto, the 45 Regulations that form the disciplinary framework for Shinsengumi members, and implements them firmly.

Okita, Sougo;Sougo Okita (沖田 総悟);"Sougo ""Sou-chan, The Prince of the Planet of Sadists, S King, Bakaiser, Fusako"" Okita";"
Age: 18
Birthdate: July 8
Height: 170 cm
Weight: 58 kg
Occupation: First Division Captain Shinsengumi

Okita is the best swordsman in the Shinsengumi. Personality-wise, he tends to be light-hearted and somewhat childish though his speech is heavily deadpan.

He outwardly displays annoyance and dislike for Hijikata, and continuously tries to harm and humiliate him whenever given the chance.


Losing his parents at a young age, he was raised by his sister, Mitsuba. Thus, although he is sadistic and violent towards other people, Okita absolutely adores his sister and does everything he can to please her. Mitsuba is one of the reasons why Okita hates Hijikata. Okita viewed Hijikata as a rival for his sister's attention. He also greatly dislikes the fact that Hijikata treated Mitsuba coldly, although Mitsuba clearly showed signs of liking Hijikata.
Okita has great affection and fondness for Kondo, who took him under his wings when he was little. He still regards Hijikata as one of his three friends (the other two being Kondo and Gintoki).

He enjoys seeing women fight, finding the ugly looks on their faces as they grab each other being hilarious. He wears a distinctive eye mask when taking a nap during duty, which is a frequent occurrence. At one point, he refers to himself as the best sniper in the Shinsengumi. Although he is a master of kenjutsu, he uses a bazooka more often.

He also regards Kagura as a rival after an unfinished rock-paper-scissors duel during a sakura-blossom party. He states that he'll ""be the only one to defeat her"", and usually calls her ""China"".

In the original Japanese manga he likes to end his sentences in ""~desaa"" and ""~desuzee.""

In Sorachi's original character design, Okita was a female, and wielded an umbrella. This concept was ultimately given to Kagura.

In the second Shounen JUMP character popularity poll, he ranked 2nd place, just below Gintoki.

In volume 12, Okita's age is revealed to be 18. Despite being under Japan's legal drinking age, in Edo, you can drink alcohol from 15.

His name is based on the historical Okita Souji."
Katsura, Kotarou;Kotarou Katsura (桂 小太郎);"Kotarou ""Zura, Fruits Punch Samurai, Zurako, Captain Katsura, Katsuo"" Katsura";"
Age: 20s
Birthday: June 26 (Cancer)
Height: 175 cm
Weight: 56 kg
Blood Type: AB

Katsura is Gintoki's former comrade during the Joi war. Even after the Amanto take-over of Japan, Katsura continues to resist the Amanto, and has amassed a band of followers. His weapon of choice is a metallic grenade. He is a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, and is constantly on the run from the Shinsengumi. Although his initial methods were originally more violent in nature (for instance, sending a bomb to an Amanto embassy), Katsura has gradually grown to believe that there are people important to him in Edo, and decides that he no longer wants to destroy the country, but believes there should be a way to change it without causing sacrifices.

Katsura seems to be highly respected by his followers, and has even been called the ""Daybreak of the Joui Faction"" by some. When people believed that Katsura had died during the Benizakura arc, even other terrorist groups tried to avenge his death.
Since he is a wanted man, Katsura is often seen wearing disguises, although his identity is often still easily found out. One example of a disguise he seems to be fond of is a pirate's costume, complete with an eyepatch (with a skull design) over his left eye and a scar on his right cheek, and using this he calls himself 'Space Captain Katsura'.

Katsura seems to possess a rather outdated sense of humour, and sometimes refers to things from a past era, such as when he tried to buy a Famicon when people were queuing up to buy the OwEe (a parody of the Wii). He also seems to have a tendency to make up dramatic stories, which moves others to tears when they hear these stories (except Gintoki).
Katsura sometimes works odd jobs (e.g. in Episode 88), to raise money for his terrorist activities. He claims that his heart has started to be moved by Ikumatsu in episode 39 (chapter 55 equivalent of the manga), and held his subsequent interview in her ramen restaurant.

In the Japanese version, Gintoki often calls him ""Zura."" In the first English volume, Gintoki calls him ""Casserole,"" or ""Cough syrup."" Eventually, the English version changed to Gintoki calling Katsura ""Zura."" In the Japanese version, Katsura indignantly replies ""Not 'Zura'! It's Katsura!"" (and will do so anytime he is called something other than his name). In the English version he replies ""Not Casserole! It's Katsura!"" The Japanese version joke is a pun, since ""Katsura"" can mean wig in Japanese and ""Zura"" is slang for the same thing. The English version is also a wordplay since ""Katsura"" and ""Casserole"" sound somewhat similar in pronunciation. He has the uncanny ability to know when someone has called him something other than Katsura, even in their head. An example being in Episode 25 as a guest to Gintoki's hotpot dinner.

His name is based on the historical Katsura Kogoro."
Hasegawa, Taizou;Taizou Hasegawa (長谷川 泰三);"Taizou ""Madao, Piggy"" Hasegawa";"
Age: 38
Birthday: June 13
Zodiac: Gemini
Height: 179 cm
Weight: 67 kg

Hasegawa used to be an official working for the Bakufu, but after an unfortunate incident with Amanto dignitary Prince Hata, whom he was assigned to serve and protect, his superior asked him to succumb to his shame and commit seppuku, hearing that he ran away from his quarters.

He initially believed that humans should focus on appeasing the Amanto, but after his encounter with Gintoki, his mindset changed, which led to him punching Hata out, thus getting fired. Since then, he has been living a life of somewhat like a loser, getting fired almost every time he gets a new job, mostly due to the unfavourable look his sunglasses and goatee give him.

No matter what, he refuses to remove his sunglasses because it's the only thing he had left to remind him of his successful past. Although he does exchange the sunglasses for a decent pair of half-moon spectacles at one point, he goes back to wearing them after he decides that he is going to live out his life in the best way he can. He is constantly seen working various part-time jobs. He is often referred to as ""Madao,"" short for ""marude damena ossan,"" which roughly translates into ""totally useless middle-aged man.""

He and Gintoki are on good terms with one another and seem to spend most of their free time gambling. He often plays pachinko, but rarely ever wins. After losing his job for the Bakufu, he is seen doing odd jobs from time to time, like running a supermarket for a friend or driving a taxi at one time.

He's currently estranged from his wife Hatsu, because of his jobless lifestyle, however they still keep in touch.

It is revealed in episode 52 that he is 38 years old after he pees his pants."
Tsukuyo;Tsukuyo  (月詠);"Tsukuyo ""Tsukki, The Moon of Yoshiwara, Shinigami Tayuu"" ";"
Birthday: February 9
Height: 170 cm (5' 7"")
Weight: 52 kg (114 lb)

Tsukuyo is a blonde-haired woman with a scar over her forehead and left cheek. One of the better known Hundred Blooms of Yoshiwara, a law enforcement squad of Yoshiwara that consists of all females, deployed by the Night King Hosen. Despite appearing to be a heartless person when approached by Odd Jobs when he arrives to Yoshiwara, throwing a fake kunai to their foreheads, she later becomes friends with them. She has a difficult past being orphaned as a child, only to be picked up and raised by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. While the original motive for Jiraia was to instill every bit of despair and tragedy of his own life into Tsukuyo, of who he refers to as his art or perfect creation, Tsukuyo ended up growing attached to what he did not manage to do. That is ""Friends, A Home, and Precious Things To Protect"" as told by Jiraia. Her loyalty and home lies with Hinowa in the underground city of Yoshiwara. She has ties with Hinowa, who also helped raise her like an older sister/mother through her childhood.


It is hinted by Jiraia (in Chapter 255/Episode 178) Hinowa and Seita (in Chapter 294) that she has romantic feelings for Gintoki. This is further supported by her scribbling out statements from Hinowa's and Seita's New Year's cards commenting how lonely she was when they heard Gintoki has gotten married and her inability to give him chocolates for Valentine's Day (in Episode 204). Tsukyo herself has confirmed that, while she doesn't quite know what they are or what to do with them, she has some feelings towards Gintoki. This was in episode 177 when she said to him, ""When I am with you, my resolve weakens. Don't shake up my feelings any further.""

Takasugi, Shinsuke;Shinsuke Takasugi (高杉晋助);Shinsuke  Takasugi;"
Age: 20s
Birthday: August 10
Zodiac: Leo
Hair: Black (purple highlights)
Eyes: Light Olive Green (bandage over left eye)
Height: 170cm
Weight: 60kg
Occupation: Leader of the Kiheitai
Hobbies: Smoking a pipe, Playing a shamisen

A former comrade of Gintoki and Katsura and a major antagonist. He now leads a radical Joui faction called the Kiheitai and is known amongst the Shinsengumi as 'the most dangerous man in both the Joui faction and amongst the radicals'. He is easily recognizable through his bandaged left eye, his colorful kimono, his eerie smile, and the pipe he is often seen smoking.

He, Gintoki, and Katsura studied in the same temple elementary school when they were children, and he fought with them against the Amanto invasion during the latter part of the Joui war. After the war ended, he vanished, and has since gained a dangerous reputation due to his assassination of many of the Bakufu's main officers and his planning of a large-scale coup d'etat. Before his first appearance in both the anime and the manga, he was mentioned to have fled Edo and to have been hiding in Kyoto, although it is unclear how long before this was.

He now believes that the only way to save it is to destroy the ""rotten"" post-Joui war world.

He is shown to like festivals, although this is mainly due to the opportunity they provide for a large-scale terrorist attack: he appears to have an attraction to ruin that is almost nihilistic. He also appears to have considerable insight due to his 'seeing through Itou's heart' and subsequently planting him in the Shinsengumi's ranks.

It can be assumed that he is as skilled a swordsman as both Gintoki and Katsura, having fought alongside them as one of the 'heroes' of the Joui war. That aside, he appears to have at least considerable skill in playing the shamisen, and is shown at one point playing it with Bansai as they talk.

He is based on the historical Takasugi Shinsaku."
Elizabeth;Elizabeth  (エリザベス, 江蓮);"Elizabeth ""Eli, Shogun Ehou, Eren"" ";"
Elizabeth resembles a giant white duck or a giant penguin and is Katsura's companion. Elizabeth was a present from Tatsuma Sakamoto, who presumably picked it up on his travels around space. Although many people consider Elizabeth to be insane and extraneous, Katsura has named the ambiguous avian ""Elizabeth"" and dotes on it. Once in episode 18 Shinpachi purchased a doll named as Space Alien Stefan (宇宙怪獣ステファン) to which looks perfectly similar to Elizabeth. Elizabeth is something of a painter, and is surprisingly dexterous. Also, Elizabeth resorts to using signboards to ""communicate,"" as well as an occasional means of attack. Elizabeth is also a skilled fighter, able to use signboards to fight off swordsmen.

Although the true identity of Elizabeth is uncertain, it appears to be a man wearing a duck costume. In its first appearance, hairy legs are seen underneath her sheet and the body of a humanoid with glowing eyes is revealed as her mouth is opened just as it fell during another battle between Gintoki and Katsura. Although Katsura seems shocked at what she really is, she has subsequently remained by his side. Episode 50 implies that the person inside Elizabeth is most likely the director (Gintoki was interrupted before he can finish being cut off at ""Kanto-"" (""Direc-""). Most of the characters seem to ignore this, or at least do not give it much thought, given at the episode was completely filler. Moreover, the next time the inside of Elizabeth is shown, it reverts to the glowing eyes.

When Shinpachi boards Takasugi's ship in order to rescue Kagura, a bazooka is seen coming out of Elizabeth's mouth when she blasts the ship to distract everyone from Shinpachi. Because of this, Shinpachi refers to her as Elizabeth-senpai.

Elizabeth's birthday is September 7. ""Her"" height is 180 centimeters, and ""she"" weighs 123 kilograms.

He started to ignore those around him (imagining them with a large X across their face) and was driven to the point of suicide. He changed his mind after he apologized to Nishimiya and began to spend time with her. He learned sign language specifically so he could apologize to her and is shown to be very talented in it. He feels like he hasn't been punished enough for bullying Nishimiya and often wishes he could kill his younger self. He seems resigned to the fact that he will never be able to have friends again."

Nishimiya's younger sister who is currently a middle school student. She cut her hair short so their mother would not cut Nishimiya's and has kept it that way ever since; due to this, she is often mistaken for a boy, with Ishida even thinking that she is Nishimiya's boyfriend at first.

Yuzuru is extremely protective of her big sister and has a deep hatred of all the people who ever bullied her, in particular Ishida; however, upon learning that Ishida has changed, she mellows down, accepts, and even encourages him to go out with her sister, though she is frustrated of their reluctance to do anything about their feelings and never moving past their relationship as friends. Yuzuru often bunks off school to take photos of dead animals and insects, which causes her and her mother to not get along.


It is later revealed that she only took these photos so that when her sister saw them she would see how horrible death is and not try to kill herself.

After having separated from him since middle school graduation, Ueno runs into Ishida years later, herself now working in a cat café.


It is revealed that Ueno is in love with Ishida and originally picked on Nishimiya to impress him, however when she learned that Nishimiya was cleaning the offensive words off Ishida's desk before he could see them she convinced herself that Nishimiya also loved Ishida and was using her disability to get his attention, leading her to grow jealous and resentful toward Nishimiya. However, unlike Ishida, Ueno never learns her lesson and continues to hate and bully Nishimiya once she reconnects with her through Kawai and Sahara (whom she remained friends with). Ueno watched Ishida suffer through middle school—still being bullied for what he did to Nishimiya—and feels bad herself for being unable to do anything. She claims that their sadness, from her having to cut off contact with Ishida to him hating everyone, including her, has all been because of Nishimiya. In truth, however, Ueno is irritated because Nishimiya never defends herself whenever she is bullied, thinking her as a weak person because of this. Despite being within the group of friends, Ishida still imagines Ueno with an X over her face, showing his disgust with her, until after his release from hospital, after which Ueno is dragged by Sahara to become her assistant as a model.

He is shown to be quite obsessive and protective of Ishida and often dislikes him befriending other people. However, Nagatsuka is also supportive of Ishida and often offers advice. He has plans to become a millionaire, so is willing to hand out money to friends and is keen to become a film director—entering himself and Ishida into a film competition. It is shown both Ueno and Kawai find Nagatsuka repulsive, while Ishida is uncomfortable that Nagatsuka is so willing to take his side when he knows so little about him. Though his film proves to be a failure, this only made Nagatsuka resolved to take up film studies as his college subject.

Sadly, this singled her out for bullying too and started to take all her classes in the nurse's office. Ishida finds Sahara several years later so she can reconnect with Nishimiya, and she becomes her friend again. She was always and is still bullied by Ueno for her unorthodox sense of fashion, however the two remain close even after they separated and Sahara boldly claims they are now best friends. Sahara has grown very tall during the time-skip and due to her high heel boots appears even taller. After Ishida, Sahara spends the most time with the Nishimiya family; however, their relationship is briefly strained when Ishida decides to cut off all ties with his friends by insulting them, claiming that Sahara is always the first to run away from a problem. Sahara later texts Ishida asking how he could prove that he has grown up; this motivates him to risk his life saving Nishimiya during her attempted suicide. Fed up of Ueno always blaming Nishimiya for everything, she chooses to take Nishimiya's side and defends her from being attacked by Ueno during Ishida's hospitalization.

However, this only makes him feel that he should be the least important amongst the group. Thus, when Ishida asks Mashiba to hit him after the former reveals his bullying records, he calmly does so. Mashiba is the first to reconcile with Ishida upon his release from hospital and later studies to become a teacher after graduation.

Senjougahara, Hitagi;Hitagi Senjougahara (戦場ヶ原 ひたぎ);"Hitagi ""Tsundere-chan, Gahara-san, Senshougahara-san"" Senjougahara";"
Birthday: July 7
Height: 165 cm
Weight: 45 kg

5 kg when she was under the influence of the heavy crab.
Hitagi, the main female character of
Bakemonogatari
, is a weak-looking girl with an ""incurable disease."" She is in the same class as Koyomi, but he has almost never heard her speak. When she was in the first year of high school, she encountered a mysterious crab, after which she became nearly weightless. Ever since then, she has avoided contact with everyone else, threatening everyone who discovers her secret. She called herself a tsundere and always speaks in an abusive style.


At the end of Mayoi Snail, she admits that she loves Koyomi, and subsequently enters into a relationship with him. After the events in Tsukihi Phoenix, she overcomes all of her trauma, and becomes a rather cheerful and normal girl. She starts calling Araragi with a cute nickname, chuckling at small things and sending e-mails full of emoticons, although her sharp tongue is still there, but toned down. She also seems to have a father complex as she becomes excited to the point of being unable to fall asleep when using her father's blanket."
Araragi, Koyomi;Koyomi Araragi (阿良々木 暦);"Koyomi ""Koyokoyo, Koyomin"" Araragi";"
Age: 18
Height: 165 cm
Weight: 55 kg

Koyomi Araragi is a third year high school student who survived a vampire attack during spring break and barely regained his human life in the time that followed as a boy with remnants of vampiric traits. He can see in the dark, his eyes turn red when he gets angry, and he heals incredibly fast. As a result, he questions his lifespan. He remains scared of morning sunlight despite the fact that it no longer has any negative effects on him.

Koyomi is a laid-back person whose only real friend at school is Tsubasa Hanekawa. He's a poor student, close to failing every class except math.

It is revealed through conversations that he's quite knowledgeable with anime; a fact even noted by Nadeko Sengoku once.

Although he is shown to be attracted to the other girls, he turns their advances down due to his loyalty to Hitagi.

Other characters seems to speculate that Koyomi is a lolicon, particularly Mayoi and Hitagi, with Hitagi thinking that Nadeko is a ""threat"" to her.

He is very noble, which is why Hitagi is attracted to him. He is willing to help others at the cost of his own life. As such, the female characters he has helped are quite attached to him. He feels most comfortable talking to Mayoi, Shinobu and, from the Second Season on, to Yotsugi about his problems.

Koyomi is the only person who thinks that his family relationship is bad, with Karen and Tsukihi thinking otherwise. His parents were revealed to be police officers.

His personality is portrayed more clearly in the novels, where his inner thoughts show him to be much more perverted and intelligent than the anime leads one to believe.

Due to events prior to
Kizumonogatari
and
Bakemonogatari
, Koyomi avoided having friends and seemed to have lost faith and trust in people and himself.

Hachikuji, Mayoi;Mayoi Hachikuji (八九寺 真宵);"Mayoi ""Hachihachiji, Hachirokuji"" Hachikuji";"
Mayoi is a fifth-grade elementary school girl. She is 144cm tall and always carries a big backpack, wears a hairband, and sports ponytails. Befitting her age, Mayoi is cheerful, energetic and inquisitive. She makes a lot of spelling mistakes and has a habit of mispronouncing Koyomi's family name. On the other hand, she does not easily trust strangers, and will even fight back against them if they become too nosy.


Ten years ago she was involved in a traffic accident and died because of it. After that she became a ghost and considers herself a ""lost snail"". She unwillingly causes the people around her to become lost and unable to find their way home. The only people who can see her are people who don't want to go home in the first place. However, after Araragi and Senjougahara help her find the home she was looking for, she changed from an ""earthbound spirit"" to a ""wandering spirit"", a fact that she considers to be a bonus, as well as granting her to be free to wander wherever she desires. At the end of Nisemonogatari, she said goodbye to Koyomi, implying that she will not be seeing him again, which will be the basis of the next story, Mayoi Jiangshi. Her family name before her parents got divorced was Tsunade.

In Shinobu Time, she is chased by the darkness together with Koyomi Araragi. It is later revealed by Izuko Gaen that the darkness was targeting Hachikuji because she remained in the town even after she was saved by Koyomi. To stop the darkness, she finally decides that she must pass on. She kisses Koyomi and confesses her love for him before she vanishes."
Oshino, Ougi;Ougi Oshino (忍野 扇);Ougi  Oshino;"
Ougi appears as a girl with short black hair, black pupils, and pale white skin and is a junior of Koyomi Araragi at Naoetsu Private High School, as Ougi refers to Koyomi as senpai. Ougi claims to be Meme Oshino's niece.

In Hanamonogatari and Orokamonogatari, Ougi appears as a male.


At the start of Kabukimonogatari, Ougi is seen having a trivial conversation with Koyomi about traffic lights, causing him to think about Mayoi Hachikuji. When Ougi meets Nadeko at the beginning of Otorimonogatari, initially appearing to merely want to tell Nadeko to stop playing the victim, it is later revealed that Ougi is the mastermind behind tricking Nadeko into becoming a snake god. Four months after Mayoi disappears, Koyomi has a conversation with Ougi in the classroom. After that, Ougi leaves by saying there is a lot of work to do. When Koyomi asks about the job, Ougi tells him it's basically work that involves punishing liars. Koyomi encounters Ougi on his way to North Shirahebi Shrine, who then states that they had been waiting there for him since morning to offer him some words of encouragement. When Koyomi says he doesn't regret turning into a vampire, they tell him that the reason they like him is because he is easy to twist around. As Koyomi walks off towards the mountain, Ougi tells him that at the cost of losing many things, he has matured. Gaen reveals that Ougi’s true identity is Araragi Koyomi himself. She is an Oddity that Araragi created, similarly to how Hanekawa’s stress created Black Hanekawa, and Sengoku’s hallucinations created the white snake Kuchinawa. Ougi represents Araragi’s self-criticism. When Araragi saw ""Darkness"" for the first time in Shinobu Time, he realized that there is a law dictating over the world of Oddity. Araragi knows that he is too weak, too hesitant, too emotional to make harsh decisions, and he subconsciously wished for a being that can judge him, and ""correct"" everything wrong in this world. His desire came true as Oshino Ougi. In Suruga Bonhead, it is implied that male and female Ougi might be different identities or are the same oddity but reshaped depended on who the ""target"" is. Male Ougi appears to ""help"" Suruga but also still works with Araragi as his helping hand."
Oshino, Shinobu;Shinobu Oshino (忍野 忍);"Shinobu ""Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade, Fair Princess"" Oshino";"
Shinobu is a girl who lives with Meme in an abandoned building. She loves donuts from ""Mister Donut."" She was named Shinobu by Meme at the beginning of Hitagi Crab, suggesting her kanji name Shinobu (忍), having ""heart"" (心) under ""blade"" (刃), matches with her original personality.


She appears to be an eight-year-old girl, but she was originally a beautiful vampire who had lived for more than 500 years. At the end of events of Koyomi Vamp, after Koyomi realizes that having saved his master from a certain death, leaded to a future where she will kill humans (the ""portable food"" she calls them) to ensure her survival, Koyomi revolts against Kissshot in a bloody battle to death, where Kissshot chooses not to use her full powers (in order to have a proper battle with her servant). Later on the battle it is revealed that she pretended to turn Koyomi into a human again, by letting herself be killed by Koyomi. After the shocking revelation, he cannot bring himself to kill his master who was giving her life for his, and who cared for him at the point of risking her life to save his (from sunburn) at the beginning of Spring's Break. But to prevent herself from eating more humans, Koyomi asked for help to Oshino Meme, who in the end tells that as a happy ending won't be possible for everyone, then everyone will have an unhappy ending! While Koyomi himself cannot return to be a fully human, Kissshot Acerolaorion Heartunderblade was left in a weakened condition (where she is no longer able to eat humans, and needs her servant's blood to survive) with no powers or traces of her original personality and therefore have to abandon her ""Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade"" (キスショット・アセロラオリオン・ハートアンダーブレード) name. Ever since ""Tsubasa Cat"" where she starts living in Araragi's shadow, she no longer needs to suck his blood on a regular basis in order to stay alive. She forms a physical connection with Araragi where they can feel each others emotions and senses. It is also later revealed that she can gain strength into an ""evolved"" form after sucking Araragi's blood more than the usual dosage, she does this in order to fight for Araragi when he confronts Yotsugi and Yozuru. In Mayoi Jiangshi, in the alternate timeline, Shinobu went berserk when Koyomi was killed by Black Hanekawa, feeling that she was somewhat responsible for his death, so she swore to destroy the world and created the Jiangshi that has been swarming the town. It seems that she truly cares about Koyomi and when she saw Koyomi was alive in the alternate timeline, she started weeping blood. In the end, Araragi simply states that he will die together with Shinobu. Her father named her Lola, however she went by the name Acerola.

Hair: Long/short black hair
Eyes: Dark-colored
Skin: Fair complexion
Height: 158cm

Favorite phrase/slogan: ""I don't know everything, I just know what I know."" (何でもは知らないわよ。知ってることだけ。, Nandemo wa shiranaiwa yo. Shitteru koto dake.)

She styles her hair into two braids and ties them with a hair ribbon that has a cat design. She is always seen dressed in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, even outside of school days, and is rarely seen on any other type of clothing, except for a set of sleepwear which she wore during Tsubasa Cat Arc.

Hanekawa Tsubasa is Araragi's classmate and the class president. Araragi describes her as ""the class president of all class presidents."" The reason Tsubasa and Hitagi cut their hair short is because they learned Araragi likes it short.

Hanekawa currently lives with her stepfather and stepmother.


Hanekawa Family's Past:

Her biological mother was 17 years old when she got pregnant, the biological father is unknown because she apparently had many lovers. Before she gave birth to Tsubasa, she married another man who was a ""workaholic."" Right after giving birth, Tsubasa's biological mother commited suicide. The workaholic stepfather, unable to raise a child, remarried again to a woman who is Tsubasa's current mother. The workaholic father soon died from overwork and the current mother married another man who is now Tsubasa's current father.

Hanekawa Story's overview in Nekomonogatari/Bakemonogatari:

Prior to the beginning of Bakemonogatari Hanekawa was possessed by a bakeneko (mischievous spirit of a dead cat) during Golden Week due to stress over her family (see Nekomonogatari: Kuro). The matter was eventually resolved with the help of Shinobu at the cost of some of Hanekawa's memories, but the problem emerged again right before the school festival because of different stress. Araragi was told by Hanekawa's bakeneko form that she has feelings for him. In ""Tsubasa Tiger"" (Nekomonogatari: Shiro), on her way to school, she met a tiger spirit which spoke to her. Soon buildings important to Hanekawa began to mysteriously burn down and ""Black Hanekawa"" (her bakeneko form) began to take over her body every time she slept. The inevitable showdown was afoot and led to some surprising events. ""Tsubasa Tiger"" is written from the perspective of Hanekawa rather than Araragi."
Kanbaru, Suruga;Suruga Kanbaru (神原 駿河);Suruga  Kanbaru;"
Suruga, the main character of Suruga Monkey, is Koyomi's underclassman, star of the school's basketball team and one of Hitagi's acquaintances from back in junior high school. She is so well known in her school that not a single student had not heard of her, mostly because it was her who was responsible of the rapid rise of success of the school's girls basketball team due to her talents. She considers herself a lesbian, fujoshi, lolicon and masochist. Her hobbies include reading yaoi literature and playing basketball. Although her sexual preference is clearly towards females, she does not have a hard time interacting with males, and she even manages to say teasing remarks when she is comfortable with the person she talks to (i.e. Araragi). She is 160cm tall.

Suruga is a girl with brown eyes and dark bluish hair. Because of her club activities as a basketball varsity player, she boasts an athletic physique, although she admits that her breasts might not be ample enough for Araragi to notice.

Her clothing style reflects her boyish personality; when she is not in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, she often wears sleeveless clothing and shorts. Whichever clothes she wears, she is regularly seen wearing cycling shorts, which she considers to be her underwear, much to Araragi's shock upon hearing it straight from her (as it implies that she does not wear panties).


Hidden from others, however, is her tendency to be jealous of others to the point of thinking of causing bodily harm to them for revenge. This would eventually fuel her killing intent as the Rainy Devil. Back in elementary school, she inherited what she thought was a monkey's paw. At this time, she had been teased at for being slow in track. Because of this, Suruga decides to use the monkey's paw to grant her wish to become the fastest among her classmates. Unexpectedly, her competitors in one race she would participate in were attacked by an unknown assailant and were absent the next day. This would soon continue for some time, and this caused Suruga to be afraid, especially upon her discovery of the novel The Monkey's Paw, which tells the story of a similar item that grants wishes for a certain price. Suruga would soon shift her focus to basketball, where she immediately shone as the school's ace player, and this caused Hitagi Senjougahara, the track ace at that time, to take notice of her talent. She and Hitagi become close friends,with Kanbaru calling their pairing the Valhalla Combo (ヴァルハラコンビ Varuhara Konbi, formed by the ""varu"" from Kanbaru and ""hara"" from Senjougahara), and she soon forgot about the monkey's paw. Immediately after she entered senior high school, she became aware of Hitagi's secret and was threatened by her, just like Koyomi was. However, unlike the persistent Araragi, Kanbaru followed Hitagi's advice and stopped talking to Hitagi since that time. However, she then started stalking Koyomi after she discovered he was dating Hitagi. In Suruga Devil, there seems to be a rumor about a devil solving other people's problem. Fearing that she might be the rumored ""Devil,"" she decided to investigate and found out that the rumored Devil is actually an old basketball rival of hers named, Numachi Rouka. It seems that Kanbaru is still worried about the effects of the Rainy Devil after it has been dispersed to the point that whenever she goes to sleep, she would bind her devil's arm to a pillar so that she wouldn't start sleepwalking and committing crimes and check the newspaper everyday so that she can make sure she didn't do anything unconsciously. She also has dreams of her mother once in a while which give her weird life lessons. She is named Kanbaru Suruga now but she was previously named Gaen Suruga. Izuko is her aunt and Suruga's mother had some kind of connection to oddities as she had inherited that devil's left arm from her mother. Her mother and father were revealed to have eloped as the Kanbaru family did not agree with their relationship. Kanbaru is also the only person that Kaiki will ever treat in a good way.

Nadeko, the main character of Nadeko Snake, is Tsukihi's friend back in elementary school. She always wears a waist pouch, always casts her eyes downward, has her bangs covering her eyes, has a shy personality, and can be easily amused. Koyomi played with her a lot whenever she visited his house after being invited by his sisters. She refers to Koyomi as Koyomi onii-chan and appears to have feelings for him.


She was cursed two times by a classmate who liked the boy she rejected, and the rejected boy. While the first one is banished, Koyomi is forced to battle the second to keep it from killing Nadeko.
She's quite protective of her hair (particularly her forelocks) thinking that it's her place to guard more than her panties. When she finally combed her forelocks aside in Nisemonogatari, Koyomi commented that she has a glare just like a serpent, probably foreshadowing the story of Nadeko Medusa.


Nadeko Medusa Arc

During Halloween, Nadeko met a girl named Ougi who gave her a white scrunchie. After, she was able to see a white serpent, Kuchinawa, in the place of it. In Nadeko's class, the atmosphere has become strained and because Nadeko is the class rep, she's been pressured to do something about it. Later on, Kuchinawa tells her to go to the shrine where she last sacrificed snakes in Bakemonogatari. He commands her to atone for what she did by finding the remains of the snake god that inhabited the shrine in the past. She tries not to involve Koyomi, but he manages to find her at night and takes her to his house. She wakes up next to Tsukihi and manages to bring up the topic of Koyomi's girlfriend. Finally, Nadeko reveals her jealousy toward Hitagi, but claims that she would never try to steal him. Tsukihi says that she planned to support her if Nadeko was going to do so. However, since Nadeko instead said she doesn't want to trouble him, Tsukihi says it's as if after all these years passed, that Nadeko is using her brother as in excuse to reject boys from her school. Tsukihi loses her patience and suddenly cuts Nadeko's fringe. This way, she wouldn't be able to hide her face or emotions anymore, which she later attempts again with her teacher. Yet without her fringe, he can see that she isn't disturbed at all. Nadeko ended up very ""uncharistically"" snapping at him and after, to her classmates. The serpent then tells Nadeko that its remains are in Araragi's house, where she finds the paper charm Gaen previously trusted Koyomi with. Kuchinawa offers to grant Nadeko any wish, and she already knows what to ask for: Koyomi to love her back. She says this in front of him, but he says that her desire cannot be granted. After some of Shinobu's provocation, Nadeko eats the charm and becomes an oddity, sharing her body with Kuchinawa, and her hair turns white with each lock becoming a snake. As an oddity, Nadeko reveals her true colors: an obsessive, egotistical, cynical girl, who would not hesitate to kill in order to keep her delusional and impossible love story."
Oshino, Meme;Meme Oshino (忍野 メメ);Meme  Oshino;"
Meme is a middle-aged man who lives in an abandoned building. Being an expert in apparitions field, he solves Koyomi and others' problems. Although he sometimes expects compensation, he does not require it always and seems to help those in need from good nature. Due to his vast knowledge of supernatural studies and general oddities, he serves as Araragi's informant during his stay in the city.

Oshino is a graduate of Shinto studies in college, although he never pursued the career of being a Shinto priest. Despite that, he is perfectly capable to accomplish spiritual works of a Shinto priest, such as exorcising entities and solving paranormal mysteries. He occasionally wears a Priest's outfit, as seen with the session with Senjougahara and the heavy crab. Meme's other notable accessories include an earring on his right ear and a necklace, both consisting of an inverted cross."
Ononoki, Yotsugi;Yotsugi Ononoki (斧乃木 余接);Yotsugi  Ononoki;"
Yotsugi was first introduced in Tsukihi Phoenix. She is Yozuru's shikigami. She always addresses herself with the masculine first-person pronoun boku and thinks of Yozuru as her sister. She has an ability called Unlimited Rulebook where she can shape-shift her finger.

She seems to know about Koyomi's past as she calls him ""Devil Boy"" (鬼いちゃん, Oni-chan).

She tends to end the things she says with ""I said, with a posed look"" (僕はキメ顔でそう言った, Boku wa kime-gao de sou itta).


After being defeated by Shinobu Oshino, she stops saying it. In Koimonogatari series, she started saying ""Yaaay"" when she first met Kaiki, but he really hated it and she stopped doing so, and started talking normally.

Yotsugi was once a human and was resurrected as a tsukumogami by Yozuru. In Nisemonogatari, Shinobu Oshino mentions that Yozuru ""probably is using the name to bind her (Yotsugi)."" and she was a supernatural creature ""that took on human form.""

She and Kagenui are specialists who specialize in immortal creatures thus they try to kill Tsukihi Araragi who is immortal and is a ""monster,"" an ""Evil Phoenix."" She was defeated by a powered up Shinobu."

Height: 177 cm
Weight: 65 kg
Likes: sweets, alcohol, Shounen Jump, strawberry milk, pachinko
Dislikes: ghosts, horror stuff
Favorite quote:
""Then and now, what I protect has never changed.""
Occupation: Yorozuya/Odd Jobs

Gintoki is a samurai living in an era when samurai are no longer needed. To add to his troubles, oppressive aliens have moved in to invade planet Earth. Gintoki works taking on odd jobs alongside two kids: Kagura and Shinpachi. In the Joui war, he was known as the ""White Devil"" (Shiroyasha) due to his silver hair and white clothing he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear in the hearts of the Amanto.

Gintoki has naturally permed silver hair, which he blames for his lacking love-life. He has a big crush on the TV's news weather girl, Ketsuno. In fact, to date, the only time he is seen to have blushed is when he tries to make use of Sadaharu and Ketsuno's dog to get a chance to talk to her.(Though he later does with Tsukuyo as well when she discovers him shopping) Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response and merely puts up with them as annoyances.

Gintoki has two major obsessions in life. He is obsessed with sweet food such as parfaits, ice cream and cakes. His second obsession is reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Shounen Jump. (Which, not coincidentally, is where Gintama is published). Gintoki will go to great lengths to get the latest Jump issue, to the point of reckless behavior. His Jump obsession makes him dream of being like other Jump heroes, including wishing that he had a ""Bankai"" similar to the characters of Bleach.

Despite his appearance and initial behavior, Gintoki has a great amount of pride for the old bushido code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he's barely acquainted with, be it a pit-fighter who was taking care of abandoned orphans or an Amanto who resembles a kappa.

Despite being a fearsome fighter with nearly unmatched skills, he avoids needless bloodshed after suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joui war.

Kagura;Kagura  (神楽);"Kagura ""Gura, China Girl, Leader, Gurako"" ";"
Age: 14
Birthday: November 3
Zodiac: Scorpio
Height: 155 cm
Weight: 40 kg

Kagura, meaning ""god-entertainment"" is a member of the Yorozuya alongside Sakata Gintoki and Shinpachi Shimura and the main female protagonist of Gintama.

Although she appears to be a normal, cute, human girl in Chinese-style clothing, she actually belongs to the Yato Clan, one of the strongest and most bloodthirsty of the Amanto races. The Yato people are said to have ""transparent"" skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan's weapon of choice; Kagura's is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motor-scooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise by her hands.

She is also extremely flexible and fast; capable of catching multiple speeding bullets between her teeth and fingers. During battle, she's often seen flipping through the air and performing various acrobatic feats. Due to her Yato blood, she is capable of rapid regeneration. During the Benizakura arc, she is seen healing from a gunshot wound almost overnight.

Kagura also has an unusually strong appetite. She is able to consume large quantities of food within a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, her tastes are endearingly plain. Sukonbu, rice, and eggs are among her favorite foods.

Her immediate family consists of her father, Umibouzu, a widely recognized alien hunter, her mother, who is deceased, and her older brother Kamui, once presumed missing who is now involved with the space pirates Harusame.

She came to Earth to earn money for her family. She found work fighting for a gang, but when they ordered her to kill her target, she ran away. Not long afterward, she met Gintoki and Shinpachi when Gintoki accidentally ran her down with his scooter. After they helped her to make a clean break from the gang, she intimidated Gintoki into hiring her. She now lives at the Yorozuya and sleeps in Gintoki's closet, like Doraemon.

Kagura and Gintoki share an odd brother-younger sister-like relationship. Together with Shinpachi, the three of them makes for a strange, dysfunctional, yet tightly knit family. Kagura is very protective of Gintoki. Although she herself has gotten into many fights with him, she rarely lets anyone else pick on him. She seems to trust wholeheartedly in Gintoki's ability and strength. Even in sticky situations, she has no doubt that Gin-chan would come and save her. She has a tendency to imitate Gintoki's bad habits (like picking her nose or swearing, hence her unladylike behavior) and would often quote the bad advice he gives her. Some of her lines start with ""Gin-chan says..."" or ""Gin-chan told me...""

Kagura is also somewhat of a tomboy. She is often seen partaking in games with various neighborhood boys. Although her candid manner of speech often causes them to shun her, she doesn't seem to mind. In fact, she has no problem at all with forcing her way into their game. In battle, she has proven to be bull-headed and a sore loser. Like Gintoki, and probably because of his influence, she is not above resorting to petty tricks and manipulation to get the better of her adversary. Unlike many conventional manga heroines, she doesn't display the same consciousness toward decorum, table manners, and physical appearance. Puking, cussing, picking her nose, spitting, fighting, and scratching herself are common behavior for Kagura.

She regards Okita, captain of the Shinsengumi, as a rival. She detests him and appeared to be disgusted when she previously mentioned (about Okita), that ""he definitely likes me,"" but as that hasn't been brought up since, it is uncertain on if it should be considered canon, that he apparently likes her.

Although Kagura usually teases Shinpachi, she deeply cares for him and thinks of him as a brother. She also shows great respect toward his older sister, Shimura Tae, often calling her ""Anego"" (a term gangster women use to show respect).

Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu (being her 27th pet), have met with an untimely demise by her hands (with the exception of Sadaharu 28,' a beetle killed by Okita). She cuddles with Sadaharu when feeling down. Kagura also seems to be the only one (aside from Ane, Mone, and Komako) who Sadaharu listens to.

According to the OVA, Kagura is the first and only Weekly Shonen Jump girl to vomit on-screen. To date, she has induced herself to vomit on several occasions. She also has an uncanny knack for seeming calm or detached during high-tension situations; in episode 5, she slept through a car-chase. Her appetite knows no bounds, and she is especially fond of sukonbu.

In Japanese, Kagura speaks in a stereotypical dialect that is associated with Chinese immigrants. In the English-translated manga, she punctuates her sentences with yup, uh-huh (aru), nope, and the like.


In the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura meets her older brother, Kamui who abandoned her because she was weak in his eyes. During the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura and Shinpachi teamed up against a Yato veteran named Abuto. When Shinpachi was mortally wounded by Abuto, Kagura can no longer hold against her Yato blood and revealed her true inner killing instincts against Abuto. Abuto is easily overwhelmed by Kagura's true power.
In the last Gintama character popularity poll, she came in the 6th place."

Age: 20s
Birthday: June 26 (Cancer)
Height: 175 cm
Weight: 56 kg
Blood Type: AB

Katsura is Gintoki's former comrade during the Joi war. Even after the Amanto take-over of Japan, Katsura continues to resist the Amanto, and has amassed a band of followers. His weapon of choice is a metallic grenade. He is a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, and is constantly on the run from the Shinsengumi. Although his initial methods were originally more violent in nature (for instance, sending a bomb to an Amanto embassy), Katsura has gradually grown to believe that there are people important to him in Edo, and decides that he no longer wants to destroy the country, but believes there should be a way to change it without causing sacrifices.

Katsura seems to be highly respected by his followers, and has even been called the ""Daybreak of the Joui Faction"" by some. When people believed that Katsura had died during the Benizakura arc, even other terrorist groups tried to avenge his death.
Since he is a wanted man, Katsura is often seen wearing disguises, although his identity is often still easily found out. One example of a disguise he seems to be fond of is a pirate's costume, complete with an eyepatch (with a skull design) over his left eye and a scar on his right cheek, and using this he calls himself 'Space Captain Katsura'.

Katsura seems to possess a rather outdated sense of humour, and sometimes refers to things from a past era, such as when he tried to buy a Famicon when people were queuing up to buy the OwEe (a parody of the Wii). He also seems to have a tendency to make up dramatic stories, which moves others to tears when they hear these stories (except Gintoki).
Katsura sometimes works odd jobs (e.g. in Episode 88), to raise money for his terrorist activities. He claims that his heart has started to be moved by Ikumatsu in episode 39 (chapter 55 equivalent of the manga), and held his subsequent interview in her ramen restaurant.

In the Japanese version, Gintoki often calls him ""Zura."" In the first English volume, Gintoki calls him ""Casserole,"" or ""Cough syrup."" Eventually, the English version changed to Gintoki calling Katsura ""Zura."" In the Japanese version, Katsura indignantly replies ""Not 'Zura'! It's Katsura!"" (and will do so anytime he is called something other than his name). In the English version he replies ""Not Casserole! It's Katsura!"" The Japanese version joke is a pun, since ""Katsura"" can mean wig in Japanese and ""Zura"" is slang for the same thing. The English version is also a wordplay since ""Katsura"" and ""Casserole"" sound somewhat similar in pronunciation. He has the uncanny ability to know when someone has called him something other than Katsura, even in their head. An example being in Episode 25 as a guest to Gintoki's hotpot dinner.

His name is based on the historical Katsura Kogoro."

Birthdate: August 12
Zodiac: Leo
Height: 166 cm
Weight: 55 kg
Age: 16

Shinpachi Shimura works under Gintoki to learn the ways of the samurai. He used to stay at his family's dōjo. However, it seems more like he's just trying to help Gintoki pay the rent than to learn. Shinpachi is the captain of the ""Otsu's Imperial Guard,"" a pop-singer's fan club.

Shinpachi meets Gintoki after Shinpachi was tripped by the ambassador of Planet Chatoran. Gintoki beats up the ambassador and his guards, not to stand up for Shinpachi, but to get revenge for his spilled parfait. Gintoki frames Shinpachi for the crime, which somehow led to him saving Shimura Tae (Otae), Shinpachi's sister, from becoming part of a brothel.

Despite his meek appearance, Shinpachi is a more than competent swordsman of his family's Kakidō-Ryu, the type of swordmanship his dojo teaches.

In the character popularity poll, he was in 8th place.

His name is roughly based on Shinsengumi member Nagakura Shinpachi and comedian Ken Shimura."

Hair: Black (purple highlights)
Eyes: Light Olive Green (bandage over left eye)
Height: 170cm
Weight: 60kg
Occupation: Leader of the Kiheitai
Hobbies: Smoking a pipe, Playing a shamisen

A former comrade of Gintoki and Katsura and a major antagonist. He now leads a radical Joui faction called the Kiheitai and is known amongst the Shinsengumi as 'the most dangerous man in both the Joui faction and amongst the radicals'. He is easily recognizable through his bandaged left eye, his colorful kimono, his eerie smile, and the pipe he is often seen smoking.

He, Gintoki, and Katsura studied in the same temple elementary school when they were children, and he fought with them against the Amanto invasion during the latter part of the Joui war. After the war ended, he vanished, and has since gained a dangerous reputation due to his assassination of many of the Bakufu's main officers and his planning of a large-scale coup d'etat. Before his first appearance in both the anime and the manga, he was mentioned to have fled Edo and to have been hiding in Kyoto, although it is unclear how long before this was.

He now believes that the only way to save it is to destroy the ""rotten"" post-Joui war world.

He is shown to like festivals, although this is mainly due to the opportunity they provide for a large-scale terrorist attack: he appears to have an attraction to ruin that is almost nihilistic. He also appears to have considerable insight due to his 'seeing through Itou's heart' and subsequently planting him in the Shinsengumi's ranks.

It can be assumed that he is as skilled a swordsman as both Gintoki and Katsura, having fought alongside them as one of the 'heroes' of the Joui war. That aside, he appears to have at least considerable skill in playing the shamisen, and is shown at one point playing it with Bansai as they talk.

He is based on the historical Takasugi Shinsaku."

Kamui is a member of the Yato Tribe, the son of Umibouzu and older brother of Kagura. His excellent fighting skills helped him become Captain of the 7th Division of Harusame's Thunder Guns, the most powerful combat unit within the Harusame group and Overlord of Yoshiwara. Since defecting from the Harusame, he no longer holds these positions.

Kamui firmly believes that the Yato are to remain on the battlefield and shows his disapproval of Housen staying locked up in Yoshiwara. Because of this belief, he shows no pity towards family or subordinates as a sign of weakness is unacceptable. He tried to revive the abandoned tradition of Yato clan's men killing their own parent to prove their strength, although failed to successfully execute it and only cut his father's arm off.

Despite this, he pays respect to the opponents he kills by sending them off with a smile. He doesn't kill children, and dislikes killing women because they may give birth to strong children."
Elizabeth;Elizabeth  (エリザベス, 江蓮);"Elizabeth ""Eli, Shogun Ehou, Eren"" ";"
Elizabeth resembles a giant white duck or a giant penguin and is Katsura's companion. Elizabeth was a present from Tatsuma Sakamoto, who presumably picked it up on his travels around space. Although many people consider Elizabeth to be insane and extraneous, Katsura has named the ambiguous avian ""Elizabeth"" and dotes on it. Once in episode 18 Shinpachi purchased a doll named as Space Alien Stefan (宇宙怪獣ステファン) to which looks perfectly similar to Elizabeth. Elizabeth is something of a painter, and is surprisingly dexterous. Also, Elizabeth resorts to using signboards to ""communicate,"" as well as an occasional means of attack. Elizabeth is also a skilled fighter, able to use signboards to fight off swordsmen.

Although the true identity of Elizabeth is uncertain, it appears to be a man wearing a duck costume. In its first appearance, hairy legs are seen underneath her sheet and the body of a humanoid with glowing eyes is revealed as her mouth is opened just as it fell during another battle between Gintoki and Katsura. Although Katsura seems shocked at what she really is, she has subsequently remained by his side. Episode 50 implies that the person inside Elizabeth is most likely the director (Gintoki was interrupted before he can finish being cut off at ""Kanto-"" (""Direc-""). Most of the characters seem to ignore this, or at least do not give it much thought, given at the episode was completely filler. Moreover, the next time the inside of Elizabeth is shown, it reverts to the glowing eyes.

When Shinpachi boards Takasugi's ship in order to rescue Kagura, a bazooka is seen coming out of Elizabeth's mouth when she blasts the ship to distract everyone from Shinpachi. Because of this, Shinpachi refers to her as Elizabeth-senpai.

Elizabeth's birthday is September 7. ""Her"" height is 180 centimeters, and ""she"" weighs 123 kilograms.

Sadaharu has the outward appearance of a giant dog, but is actually an inugami. When sitting on his haunches, he is taller than most humans. He was left in front of Gintoki's apartment in a box that had ""To Mr. Freelancer"" written on it. Sadaharu chomps on anything smaller than itself, such as Gintoki's and other people's heads. Kagura seems to be the only one who can control him, for she has immense strength, though he chomps on her occasionally. Though he was dangerous when Gintoki first received him, he has become quite tame in the later episodes, and has helped the main characters in many occasions. He was named by Kagura, after her first pet, a rabbit which she accidentally killed while having a nightmare. He was originally owned by a pair of miko sisters, who initially called him Kamiko.

Recently, Sadaharu has impressed a yakuza's boss and receives permission to date his dog (whom Sadaharu himself has fallen in love for).

Gintoki often corrects him, citing that if he were named Kintoki, they would be in some kind of hentai anime (because 'Kin' from 'Kintoki' instead of 'Gin' would make the title 'Kintama', which means 'testicles' instead of 'Gintama', which means 'silver soul').

Despite his goofy nature, Sakamoto is actually a successful businessman in the galaxy. He believes that business is a way of protecting his country. He has a private, well-equipped defensive business fleet.

Tomoya Okazaki is the male protagonist of Clannad. Due to his habit of always arriving late to school, skipping classes during the day, and staying out all night, he has been labeled as a delinquent, or a young person who defies authority.

He is a childhood friend of Kotomi Ichinose and is best friends with Youhei Sunohara. As he progresses through high school, he meets many new friends, such as Kyou, Ryou, Tomoyo, Fuko, and of course Nagisa. He has a knack for solving the problems of his friends, and seems to care for all of them deeply. He is also seemingly unaware that some of the girls at school show interest in him.

The major story in Clannad is about Tomoya learning about the point of having family and friends. He also has alternate timeline counterparts that end up with Tomoyo and Kyou respectively in the anime.

Ever since his mother, Atsuko, died in a car accident when he was young, Tomoya has been living with his father, Naoyuki Okazaki, with whom he argues constantly. Tomoya was injured during a fight with his father three years ago; since then, their relationship has been very distant.


Tomoya later marries Nagisa, where they soon have a child, Ushio, together. But upon giving birth, Nagisa dies soon after. Having felt he has lost everything, Tomoya leaves his daughter Ushio to live with Akio and Sanae for the next five years, where he constantly works and wastes money to forget the pain of losing Nagisa. When Ushio turns five years old, Tomoya reluctantly takes her on a trip with him, where they quickly bond and he asks Ushio to stay with him. Ushio contracts the same illness as Nagisa, and, grief stricken, Tomoya quits his job to take care of her. She begs to go on a trip with him, and he agrees. As they walk towards the train station in the snow, Ushio collapses and dies in her father's arms. Tomoya, crying for Nagisa to help him, collapses soon after, and awakens to a world where Nagisa and Ushio survive. It is later found out that Tomoya had used the orbs of light to grant his wish of his wife and daughter surviving. The three live together happily as a family."

Tomoya, finding it strange that she would prefer this type of toy, learns that Ushio has a some interest in robots; thus he also calls her ""boyish"". Ushio also appears to like baseball. Ushio's interest has been influenced by her grandfather who teaches her to imitate famous baseball players. She refers to Akio Furukawa as ""Akii"" and calls her grandmother by her given name ""Sanae"".

In the few earlier episodes of the stories, Ushio stays with Sanae and Akio. During her time with her grandparents, she learns to be a baseball addict like Akio, Ushio also learns strict disciplines from Sanae not to cry unless it is in the restroom


As the story progresses with Tomoya's recovery, she starts to live with her father. As she lives with her father, she later becomes friends with Ibuki Fuko, the sister of her mother's old teacher, Ibuki Kouko. Due to the lack of time Tomoya can spend with Ushio, she sneaks out of her father's house to view a hospital she refers to as ""pleasant.""

As they walk towards the train station in the snow, Ushio collapses, whispers ""I love you"" to her father, before dying in his arms.

Occupation: Yorozuya/Odd Jobs

Gintoki is a samurai living in an era when samurai are no longer needed. To add to his troubles, oppressive aliens have moved in to invade planet Earth. Gintoki works taking on odd jobs alongside two kids: Kagura and Shinpachi. In the Joui war, he was known as the ""White Devil"" (Shiroyasha) due to his silver hair and white clothing he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear in the hearts of the Amanto.

Gintoki has naturally permed silver hair, which he blames for his lacking love-life. He has a big crush on the TV's news weather girl, Ketsuno. In fact, to date, the only time he is seen to have blushed is when he tries to make use of Sadaharu and Ketsuno's dog to get a chance to talk to her.(Though he later does with Tsukuyo as well when she discovers him shopping) Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response and merely puts up with them as annoyances.

Gintoki has two major obsessions in life. He is obsessed with sweet food such as parfaits, ice cream and cakes. His second obsession is reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Shounen Jump. (Which, not coincidentally, is where Gintama is published). Gintoki will go to great lengths to get the latest Jump issue, to the point of reckless behavior. His Jump obsession makes him dream of being like other Jump heroes, including wishing that he had a ""Bankai"" similar to the characters of Bleach.

Despite his appearance and initial behavior, Gintoki has a great amount of pride for the old bushido code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he's barely acquainted with, be it a pit-fighter who was taking care of abandoned orphans or an Amanto who resembles a kappa.

Despite being a fearsome fighter with nearly unmatched skills, he avoids needless bloodshed after suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joui war.

Kagura, meaning ""god-entertainment"" is a member of the Yorozuya alongside Sakata Gintoki and Shinpachi Shimura and the main female protagonist of Gintama.

Although she appears to be a normal, cute, human girl in Chinese-style clothing, she actually belongs to the Yato Clan, one of the strongest and most bloodthirsty of the Amanto races. The Yato people are said to have ""transparent"" skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan's weapon of choice; Kagura's is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motor-scooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise by her hands.

She is also extremely flexible and fast; capable of catching multiple speeding bullets between her teeth and fingers. During battle, she's often seen flipping through the air and performing various acrobatic feats. Due to her Yato blood, she is capable of rapid regeneration. During the Benizakura arc, she is seen healing from a gunshot wound almost overnight.

Kagura also has an unusually strong appetite. She is able to consume large quantities of food within a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, her tastes are endearingly plain. Sukonbu, rice, and eggs are among her favorite foods.

Her immediate family consists of her father, Umibouzu, a widely recognized alien hunter, her mother, who is deceased, and her older brother Kamui, once presumed missing who is now involved with the space pirates Harusame.

She came to Earth to earn money for her family. She found work fighting for a gang, but when they ordered her to kill her target, she ran away. Not long afterward, she met Gintoki and Shinpachi when Gintoki accidentally ran her down with his scooter. After they helped her to make a clean break from the gang, she intimidated Gintoki into hiring her. She now lives at the Yorozuya and sleeps in Gintoki's closet, like Doraemon.

Kagura and Gintoki share an odd brother-younger sister-like relationship. Together with Shinpachi, the three of them makes for a strange, dysfunctional, yet tightly knit family. Kagura is very protective of Gintoki. Although she herself has gotten into many fights with him, she rarely lets anyone else pick on him. She seems to trust wholeheartedly in Gintoki's ability and strength. Even in sticky situations, she has no doubt that Gin-chan would come and save her. She has a tendency to imitate Gintoki's bad habits (like picking her nose or swearing, hence her unladylike behavior) and would often quote the bad advice he gives her. Some of her lines start with ""Gin-chan says..."" or ""Gin-chan told me...""

Kagura is also somewhat of a tomboy. She is often seen partaking in games with various neighborhood boys. Although her candid manner of speech often causes them to shun her, she doesn't seem to mind. In fact, she has no problem at all with forcing her way into their game. In battle, she has proven to be bull-headed and a sore loser. Like Gintoki, and probably because of his influence, she is not above resorting to petty tricks and manipulation to get the better of her adversary. Unlike many conventional manga heroines, she doesn't display the same consciousness toward decorum, table manners, and physical appearance. Puking, cussing, picking her nose, spitting, fighting, and scratching herself are common behavior for Kagura.

She regards Okita, captain of the Shinsengumi, as a rival. She detests him and appeared to be disgusted when she previously mentioned (about Okita), that ""he definitely likes me,"" but as that hasn't been brought up since, it is uncertain on if it should be considered canon, that he apparently likes her.

Although Kagura usually teases Shinpachi, she deeply cares for him and thinks of him as a brother. She also shows great respect toward his older sister, Shimura Tae, often calling her ""Anego"" (a term gangster women use to show respect).

Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu (being her 27th pet), have met with an untimely demise by her hands (with the exception of Sadaharu 28,' a beetle killed by Okita). She cuddles with Sadaharu when feeling down. Kagura also seems to be the only one (aside from Ane, Mone, and Komako) who Sadaharu listens to.

According to the OVA, Kagura is the first and only Weekly Shonen Jump girl to vomit on-screen. To date, she has induced herself to vomit on several occasions. She also has an uncanny knack for seeming calm or detached during high-tension situations; in episode 5, she slept through a car-chase. Her appetite knows no bounds, and she is especially fond of sukonbu.

In Japanese, Kagura speaks in a stereotypical dialect that is associated with Chinese immigrants. In the English-translated manga, she punctuates her sentences with yup, uh-huh (aru), nope, and the like.


In the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura meets her older brother, Kamui who abandoned her because she was weak in his eyes. During the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura and Shinpachi teamed up against a Yato veteran named Abuto. When Shinpachi was mortally wounded by Abuto, Kagura can no longer hold against her Yato blood and revealed her true inner killing instincts against Abuto. Abuto is easily overwhelmed by Kagura's true power.
In the last Gintama character popularity poll, she came in the 6th place."

Birthdate: August 12
Zodiac: Leo
Height: 166 cm
Weight: 55 kg
Age: 16

Shinpachi Shimura works under Gintoki to learn the ways of the samurai. He used to stay at his family's dōjo. However, it seems more like he's just trying to help Gintoki pay the rent than to learn. Shinpachi is the captain of the ""Otsu's Imperial Guard,"" a pop-singer's fan club.

Shinpachi meets Gintoki after Shinpachi was tripped by the ambassador of Planet Chatoran. Gintoki beats up the ambassador and his guards, not to stand up for Shinpachi, but to get revenge for his spilled parfait. Gintoki frames Shinpachi for the crime, which somehow led to him saving Shimura Tae (Otae), Shinpachi's sister, from becoming part of a brothel.

Despite his meek appearance, Shinpachi is a more than competent swordsman of his family's Kakidō-Ryu, the type of swordmanship his dojo teaches.

In the character popularity poll, he was in 8th place.

His name is roughly based on Shinsengumi member Nagakura Shinpachi and comedian Ken Shimura."

Birthday: May 5 (Children's Day in Japan)
Zodiac: Taurus
Age: 27
Blood type: A
Height: 177 cm
Weight: 64 kg
Others: right-handed, chain smoker
Affiliations: Shinsengumi

Hijikata is the famed chain smoking, vice commander of the Shinsengumi so named by his subordinates, because of his fearsome demeanor. Purportedly the brains behind the force, he takes his work seriously, and is fiercely loyal to his leader, Isao Kondo.

Hijikata has a reputation as a fearsome leader, earning the nickname of ""demonic vice-commander."" He is also hot-tempered and often speaks of seppuku. However, despite his cold exterior, he does have a more compassionate side. He also has a tendency to cry after watching movies that are not particularly emotional.

Hijikata is obsessed with mayonnaise and thus has the nickname ""Mayora."" He has been known to smother anything he eats under a mountain of mayonnaise, and he carries a number of objects shaped like jars of mayonnaise, such as his cigarette lighter. He was popular with girls until they discovered this obsession.

He enjoys fighting and sees Gintoki as a rival in practically everything he does from drinking contests to rock, paper, scissors ever since being defeated by him in battle. He is in constant danger of being killed by the attempts on his life by Okita. But, despite all this, he sees Okita as one of his close friends, and vice versa.

Before joining Shinsengumi, he used to be a trouble-maker ronin. He enjoys fighting/having a good fight and says he doesn't care how many Amanto buildings get blown up, he only looks forward to having a big battle with the Joui rebels after Shinsengumi has rounded them in 1 fell swoop, in Episode 5.

He also formulated the Kyokuchuu Hatto, the 45 Regulations that form the disciplinary framework for Shinsengumi members, and implements them firmly.

Age: 18
Birthdate: July 8
Height: 170 cm
Weight: 58 kg
Occupation: First Division Captain Shinsengumi

Okita is the best swordsman in the Shinsengumi. Personality-wise, he tends to be light-hearted and somewhat childish though his speech is heavily deadpan.

He outwardly displays annoyance and dislike for Hijikata, and continuously tries to harm and humiliate him whenever given the chance.


Losing his parents at a young age, he was raised by his sister, Mitsuba. Thus, although he is sadistic and violent towards other people, Okita absolutely adores his sister and does everything he can to please her. Mitsuba is one of the reasons why Okita hates Hijikata. Okita viewed Hijikata as a rival for his sister's attention. He also greatly dislikes the fact that Hijikata treated Mitsuba coldly, although Mitsuba clearly showed signs of liking Hijikata.
Okita has great affection and fondness for Kondo, who took him under his wings when he was little. He still regards Hijikata as one of his three friends (the other two being Kondo and Gintoki).

He enjoys seeing women fight, finding the ugly looks on their faces as they grab each other being hilarious. He wears a distinctive eye mask when taking a nap during duty, which is a frequent occurrence. At one point, he refers to himself as the best sniper in the Shinsengumi. Although he is a master of kenjutsu, he uses a bazooka more often.

He also regards Kagura as a rival after an unfinished rock-paper-scissors duel during a sakura-blossom party. He states that he'll ""be the only one to defeat her"", and usually calls her ""China"".

In the original Japanese manga he likes to end his sentences in ""~desaa"" and ""~desuzee.""

In Sorachi's original character design, Okita was a female, and wielded an umbrella. This concept was ultimately given to Kagura.

In the second Shounen JUMP character popularity poll, he ranked 2nd place, just below Gintoki.

In volume 12, Okita's age is revealed to be 18. Despite being under Japan's legal drinking age, in Edo, you can drink alcohol from 15.

His name is based on the historical Okita Souji."
Katsura, Kotarou;Kotarou Katsura (桂 小太郎);"Kotarou ""Zura, Fruits Punch Samurai, Zurako, Captain Katsura, Katsuo"" Katsura";"
Age: 20s
Birthday: June 26 (Cancer)
Height: 175 cm
Weight: 56 kg
Blood Type: AB

Katsura is Gintoki's former comrade during the Joi war. Even after the Amanto take-over of Japan, Katsura continues to resist the Amanto, and has amassed a band of followers. His weapon of choice is a metallic grenade. He is a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, and is constantly on the run from the Shinsengumi. Although his initial methods were originally more violent in nature (for instance, sending a bomb to an Amanto embassy), Katsura has gradually grown to believe that there are people important to him in Edo, and decides that he no longer wants to destroy the country, but believes there should be a way to change it without causing sacrifices.

Katsura seems to be highly respected by his followers, and has even been called the ""Daybreak of the Joui Faction"" by some. When people believed that Katsura had died during the Benizakura arc, even other terrorist groups tried to avenge his death.
Since he is a wanted man, Katsura is often seen wearing disguises, although his identity is often still easily found out. One example of a disguise he seems to be fond of is a pirate's costume, complete with an eyepatch (with a skull design) over his left eye and a scar on his right cheek, and using this he calls himself 'Space Captain Katsura'.

Katsura seems to possess a rather outdated sense of humour, and sometimes refers to things from a past era, such as when he tried to buy a Famicon when people were queuing up to buy the OwEe (a parody of the Wii). He also seems to have a tendency to make up dramatic stories, which moves others to tears when they hear these stories (except Gintoki).
Katsura sometimes works odd jobs (e.g. in Episode 88), to raise money for his terrorist activities. He claims that his heart has started to be moved by Ikumatsu in episode 39 (chapter 55 equivalent of the manga), and held his subsequent interview in her ramen restaurant.

In the Japanese version, Gintoki often calls him ""Zura."" In the first English volume, Gintoki calls him ""Casserole,"" or ""Cough syrup."" Eventually, the English version changed to Gintoki calling Katsura ""Zura."" In the Japanese version, Katsura indignantly replies ""Not 'Zura'! It's Katsura!"" (and will do so anytime he is called something other than his name). In the English version he replies ""Not Casserole! It's Katsura!"" The Japanese version joke is a pun, since ""Katsura"" can mean wig in Japanese and ""Zura"" is slang for the same thing. The English version is also a wordplay since ""Katsura"" and ""Casserole"" sound somewhat similar in pronunciation. He has the uncanny ability to know when someone has called him something other than Katsura, even in their head. An example being in Episode 25 as a guest to Gintoki's hotpot dinner.

His name is based on the historical Katsura Kogoro."

Zodiac: Gemini
Height: 179 cm

Hasegawa used to be an official working for the Bakufu, but after an unfortunate incident with Amanto dignitary Prince Hata, whom he was assigned to serve and protect, his superior asked him to succumb to his shame and commit seppuku, hearing that he ran away from his quarters.

He initially believed that humans should focus on appeasing the Amanto, but after his encounter with Gintoki, his mindset changed, which led to him punching Hata out, thus getting fired. Since then, he has been living a life of somewhat like a loser, getting fired almost every time he gets a new job, mostly due to the unfavourable look his sunglasses and goatee give him.

No matter what, he refuses to remove his sunglasses because it's the only thing he had left to remind him of his successful past. Although he does exchange the sunglasses for a decent pair of half-moon spectacles at one point, he goes back to wearing them after he decides that he is going to live out his life in the best way he can. He is constantly seen working various part-time jobs. He is often referred to as ""Madao,"" short for ""marude damena ossan,"" which roughly translates into ""totally useless middle-aged man.""

He and Gintoki are on good terms with one another and seem to spend most of their free time gambling. He often plays pachinko, but rarely ever wins. After losing his job for the Bakufu, he is seen doing odd jobs from time to time, like running a supermarket for a friend or driving a taxi at one time.

He's currently estranged from his wife Hatsu, because of his jobless lifestyle, however they still keep in touch.

It is revealed in episode 52 that he is 38 years old after he pees his pants."
Tsukuyo;Tsukuyo  (月詠);"Tsukuyo ""Tsukki, The Moon of Yoshiwara, Shinigami Tayuu"" ";"
Birthday: February 9
Height: 170 cm (5' 7"")
Weight: 52 kg (114 lb)

Tsukuyo is a blonde-haired woman with a scar over her forehead and left cheek. One of the better known Hundred Blooms of Yoshiwara, a law enforcement squad of Yoshiwara that consists of all females, deployed by the Night King Hosen. Despite appearing to be a heartless person when approached by Odd Jobs when he arrives to Yoshiwara, throwing a fake kunai to their foreheads, she later becomes friends with them. She has a difficult past being orphaned as a child, only to be picked up and raised by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. While the original motive for Jiraia was to instill every bit of despair and tragedy of his own life into Tsukuyo, of who he refers to as his art or perfect creation, Tsukuyo ended up growing attached to what he did not manage to do. That is ""Friends, A Home, and Precious Things To Protect"" as told by Jiraia. Her loyalty and home lies with Hinowa in the underground city of Yoshiwara. She has ties with Hinowa, who also helped raise her like an older sister/mother through her childhood.


It is hinted by Jiraia (in Chapter 255/Episode 178) Hinowa and Seita (in Chapter 294) that she has romantic feelings for Gintoki. This is further supported by her scribbling out statements from Hinowa's and Seita's New Year's cards commenting how lonely she was when they heard Gintoki has gotten married and her inability to give him chocolates for Valentine's Day (in Episode 204). Tsukyo herself has confirmed that, while she doesn't quite know what they are or what to do with them, she has some feelings towards Gintoki. This was in episode 177 when she said to him, ""When I am with you, my resolve weakens. Don't shake up my feelings any further.""

Takasugi, Shinsuke;Shinsuke Takasugi (高杉晋助);Shinsuke  Takasugi;"
Age: 20s
Birthday: August 10
Zodiac: Leo
Hair: Black (purple highlights)
Eyes: Light Olive Green (bandage over left eye)
Height: 170cm
Weight: 60kg
Occupation: Leader of the Kiheitai
Hobbies: Smoking a pipe, Playing a shamisen

A former comrade of Gintoki and Katsura and a major antagonist. He now leads a radical Joui faction called the Kiheitai and is known amongst the Shinsengumi as 'the most dangerous man in both the Joui faction and amongst the radicals'. He is easily recognizable through his bandaged left eye, his colorful kimono, his eerie smile, and the pipe he is often seen smoking.

He, Gintoki, and Katsura studied in the same temple elementary school when they were children, and he fought with them against the Amanto invasion during the latter part of the Joui war. After the war ended, he vanished, and has since gained a dangerous reputation due to his assassination of many of the Bakufu's main officers and his planning of a large-scale coup d'etat. Before his first appearance in both the anime and the manga, he was mentioned to have fled Edo and to have been hiding in Kyoto, although it is unclear how long before this was.

He now believes that the only way to save it is to destroy the ""rotten"" post-Joui war world.

He is shown to like festivals, although this is mainly due to the opportunity they provide for a large-scale terrorist attack: he appears to have an attraction to ruin that is almost nihilistic. He also appears to have considerable insight due to his 'seeing through Itou's heart' and subsequently planting him in the Shinsengumi's ranks.

It can be assumed that he is as skilled a swordsman as both Gintoki and Katsura, having fought alongside them as one of the 'heroes' of the Joui war. That aside, he appears to have at least considerable skill in playing the shamisen, and is shown at one point playing it with Bansai as they talk.

He is based on the historical Takasugi Shinsaku."

Kamui is a member of the Yato Tribe, the son of Umibouzu and older brother of Kagura. His excellent fighting skills helped him become Captain of the 7th Division of Harusame's Thunder Guns, the most powerful combat unit within the Harusame group and Overlord of Yoshiwara. Since defecting from the Harusame, he no longer holds these positions.

Kamui firmly believes that the Yato are to remain on the battlefield and shows his disapproval of Housen staying locked up in Yoshiwara. Because of this belief, he shows no pity towards family or subordinates as a sign of weakness is unacceptable. He tried to revive the abandoned tradition of Yato clan's men killing their own parent to prove their strength, although failed to successfully execute it and only cut his father's arm off.

Despite this, he pays respect to the opponents he kills by sending them off with a smile. He doesn't kill children, and dislikes killing women because they may give birth to strong children."

Current Concerns: Being unable to hold the ball in one hand
Ability Parameters (out of 5): Power = 1; jump = 5; stamina = 5; intellect = 1; technique = 1; speed = 5

Hinata has an unusually high ability to jump. Since he was young, Hinata trained his legs to compensate for his lack of height. He joins Karusuno High School Volleyball team and amazes the team with his natural affinity as a spiker. Although he is a complete beginner and never had any experience playing in a volleyball team, he grows rapidly through each match.

Hinata has a cheerful and energetic personality. He's a natural schmoozer and his teammates would sometimes use him to win someone over, such as Nishinoya. Hinata gets excited easily and often talks loudly. He is the loudest member after Nishinoya and Tanaka. He is friendly and can befriend anyone easily, such as Kenma from Nekoma High and Aone from Date Tech High.

Despite his easy-going personality, Hinata is extremely competitive, especially when it comes to volleyball. As stated by Sugawara, Hinata has a very big fortitude to win and thus, doesn't give up easily during a match no matter if it's a practice match or a real match. Hinata can also exhibit a very scary and intimidating face when people underestimate him. Despite that, Hinata gets scared easily, especially by larger and stronger opponents. However, he recovers quickly and will then confidently challenge the opponents.

Current Concerns: He's worried that animals seem to dislike him
Ability Parameters (out of 5): Power = 4; jump = 4; stamina = 5; intellect = 5; technique = 5; speed = 4

Kageyama was initially referred to as ""King of the Court,"" a derogatory nickname that insinuates his autocratic nature, given to him by his former teammates at Kitagawa Daiichi during his late middle school days. Kageyama is widely regarded as a stunning prodigy and an absolute genius by many of the prefecture's players and coaches. After joining Karasuno, he manages to change his attitude for the better with the help of his new teammates and rediscover what it means to be part of a team.

Unbeknownst to the majority of his schoolmates and acquaintances, however, he is actually much more sensitive and childish than he appears to be; he simply does not know how to control his frustration and express his thoughts and emotions in an appropriate way.

Since joining Karasuno, he has grown to be more respectful of his upperclassmen (Sugawara and Asahi in particular), as well as more accepting of people whose abilities and/or views differ from his own, and has come to once again understand the importance of teamwork and mutual trust in the sport he treasures so much. This has also helped him regain his confidence as a setter.

Yuu is a very energetic and temperamental person. His boisterous nature and crazy shenanigans can attract unwanted attention quite easily, which often bodes ill for him. Although he hardly ever worries about the consequences of his actions (and may even revert to violence in order to vent out his anger on certain occasions), he is surprisingly considerate of his friends' feelings and insecurities.

Yuu can be extremely impatient, excitable and impulsive. As Ryuunosuke Tanaka puts it, ""he simply gets too fired up for his own good."" He doesn't bother to filter his words, and is therefore prone to blurting out whatever he's thinking in a loud and tactless manner. In-game, however, his attitude changes drastically: he becomes incredibly focused and serious, remaining calm and doing everything in his power to provide the support his team needs until the very end. For this reason, everyone in the volleyball club respects him greatly.

The captain and setter of the Aoba Jousai High School Volleyball Club. Oikawa was also Kageyama's senpai when they were attending Kitagawa Daiichi. According to Kageyama, he is a very talented setter and volleyball player with a bad personality.

Oikawa also frequently makes cheerful remarks, but follows them up with serious or intimidating afterthoughts. Despite his flirtatious and blasé exterior, Oikawa is extremely intelligent and cunning, to the point of his own teammates stating they wouldn't want to be friends with him because he figures out everyone's weakness.

He holds a grudge against Kageyama, whom he mockingly calls Tobio-chan. This is due to his feelings of inferiority when compared to Kageyama, who has been hailed as a genius setter since their time spent at Kitagawa Daiichi. Kageyama can unintentionally bring out the more childish or rash aspects of Oikawa's personality.

A member of the Karasuno High volleyball club, Tsukishima is very blunt and has a habit of riling people up (usually Hinata, Kageyama, and even his senpais Tanaka and Nishinoya). He dislikes “hot-blooded people” and doesn’t like to exert too much effort due to the past experiences of his older brother. Aside from others like Daichi, Sugawara, and Asahi, he has little to no respect for his other teammates and is shown to be quite irritated at having to be close to them (seen as Karasuno huddled up to build up their spirits and again when he expressed disgust in having to stay with the team during training camp). He can even be rude to Yamaguchi (the person closest to him) which really shows his spiteful personality. The second years think of him as someone with a warped personality. He also teases Kageyama both by calling him ""the king"" as well as referring to the rest of the players as common folk, which angers him to the core.

Being the vice captain, he has a soothing personality for his teammates and acts as a pillar of support for them. Even though he isn't Karasuno's official setter anymore, he doesn't dream of giving up on playing in general. As such, he encourages himself and all of his teammates not to give up, no matter how rough the situation might be.

Sugawara's dedication to volleyball is clear when he decides to continue club activities even when most third years choose to retire to focus on their futures. In a meeting, his teacher asked Sugawara why he's so determined to continue playing even though he's not a starting member, and Sugawara replied that he doesn't want to have regrets in the future.

He is also quite perceptive as he noticed how Tanaka asked for the key to the gym (back during the first years's 3-on-3 match) even though he always comes in late, so Sugawara knew that something was up. He is also intelligent as he can come up with helpful tactics during the game. An example of this is when he came up with the idea of saying ""bring it"" and ""send it to me"" for Kageyama and Hinata's combo.

He has a playful, energetic and child-like personality and is described by his team as having mood swings, where even the slightest thing can change his mood which then impacts his performance. He is often referred to as 'simple-minded' because of this, but is both admired by his own team and the opponents for his impressive skills and morale-boosting demeanor.

When he makes a comeback, he clearly shows his pride as the ace and believes he is the 'strongest'. Bokuto is energetic (similar to Hinata), often making jokes about everything and acting rather dramatically about his plays. His personality is so compatible that he gets along with many people. However, he's rather ignorant to other people's discomfort, such as with Tsukishima.

Loud, hot-headed and easily angered, he is no stranger to picking fights. He is also somewhat of a slacker, shown by his less-than-stellar work ethic in school. Despite all this, he is shown to be caring and supportive towards his teammates, and even protective of his underclassmen.

Once he gets fired up, he is usually unstoppable on the court—and also unstoppably loud, as demonstrated by his over-the-top cheering after scoring the first point in Karasuno's match against Tokonami, which resulted in a warning."

Yamaguchi is a pretty shy person who relies on others. Though he is generally a nice person, he tends to snicker along or join in with Tsukishima whenever he's mocking others. He is hardworking, as shown when he sought for extra training on his own, and how he continued practicing outside of the team after seeing how weak he was compared to his other teammates. After a fatal loss in the match against Aobajōsai High, he gained a lot of confidence thanks to his teammates and Makoto Shimada. During the summer training camp, he even stood up against Kei Tsukishima, who was surprised and called him ""cool"" for the first time.

Lelouch is introduced in the first episode of the series as a student of Ashford Academy high school, where he is a member of its student council. A brilliant thinker who is quite talented at chess, he lives with his younger sister, Nunnally, with their maid, Sayoko Shinozaki, at a house situated within the compounds of Ashford Academy, where they are looked after by the Ashford family.

Lelouch is soon swept into the conflict between the Britannia Empire and the pockets of resistance which oppose it when he accidentally boards a truck being used by Japanese resistance operatives. Within the truck is a capsule holding C.C., who sacrifices herself to save him from the military forces trying to recapture her. When it seems as if her sacrifice was pointless, C.C. suddenly touches his hand and offers him the ""Power of the King,"" the mythical power of Geass. The Geass manifests itself in him as the power of absolute obedience, which allows him to make people obey his orders without question.

With his new power, Lelouch begins his rebellion against the Empire, forming the Order of the Black Knights and takes up the identity of Zero to lead them, becoming a revolutionary and gaining popular support amongst the people.


Lelouch is the son of the Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia, and the late Imperial Consort Marianne, making Lelouch the eleventh prince of the Britannian Imperial Family. He was seventeenth in line for the throne prior to his mother's assassination and his sister's crippling in the same incident. A ten-year-old Lelouch confronted the Emperor afterward and accused him of leaving his mother defenseless, even going as far as renouncing his entitlement to the throne. In response, his father banished him to Japan, where he was used as a political hostage in the Sakuradite conflict. It was during his stay at the Kururugi household that he first met Suzaku Kururugi, with whom the young Lelouch did not interact initially in a friendly manner, before later becoming friends. However, when Britannia finally developed its Knightmare Frames fleet and decided to invade Japan to seize control of the Sakuradite mines, consequently discarding Lelouch's use as a diplomatic tool, Lelouch, fearing for his and his sister's safety, hid their true identities and sought the help of the Ashford family, who were his mother's allies. His mother's death and his father's apparent lack of concern in regards to it were huge blows to Lelouch. He always felt that it was unfair for both his mother and sister, and therefore made it his goal to pursue a better world for Nunnally. He also seeks to discover the true reason for his mother's death, as she was murdered in the Aries Imperial Palace, a place terrorists would be unlikely to penetrate successfully without being noticed, if at all. Shortly after gaining the power of Geass from C.C., Lelouch assumes the secret identity Zero, a mysterious, masked revolutionary dressed in a black helmet and cloak. The helmet has a retractable plate over the left eye so Lelouch can use his Geass. In this guise, he forms the Order of the Black Knights, initially composed of the members of Kallen Kōzuki's resistance group. The goal of this vigilante group is a campaign against powerful individuals who oppress the helpless, which he eventually expands into reforming Japan as an independent nation. Lelouch is willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish his goal, even if it means lying to his followers and using people as bait for the outcome he desires. However, he has trouble putting those he is close to in harms way for the sake of his goal, which is a weakness as a commander but a remnant of his humanity and sanity. His feelings for Nunnally in particular often hinders his plans, particularly at the end of the first season, where he abandons a massive war with Britannian forces to rescue her. Gradually, however, he has come to embrace the fact that he has to destroy before reconstruction can occur, even if it means harming those he cares about. Originally, Lelouch is motivated by the desire to avenge his mother's death and construct an ideal world where his sister Nunnally can live in peace. After Nunnally becomes Viceroy of Area 11, and her wishes conflict with his goals, his friends help him to realize that his rebellion is no longer just for Nunnally, but for all the people of the world. Following Nunnally's death and the betrayal of the Black Knights, Lelouch focuses on making sure that he at least takes the Emperor down with him. The turning point in his rebellion comes when Euphemia li Britannia declares the region under Mount Fuji the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, giving the Japanese people their name and country back, albeit in a much smaller area. This effectively destroys any possibility of the Black Knights' rebellion; acceptance would render them powerless and refusal would make them pariahs. Lelouch confronts her at the opening ceremony and tries to have her shoot him, hoping to make himself a martyr. When she says she plans to give up her title, he surrenders and agrees to work with her. However, at this moment his Geass permanently activates, and an offhand comment about ordering her to kill the Japanese forces her to do just that. Lelouch reluctantly kills her and uses the massacre as an excuse to declare Japan an independent nation. He then leads an attack on the Tokyo Settlement. The attack goes well at first, but when Lelouch learns that Nunnally has been kidnapped, he abandons the battle, leaving his forces helpless against the much better organized Britannian forces. Lelouch and C.C. make their way to Kaminejima to search for Nunnally, where Lelouch is confronted by Suzaku Kururugi. Lelouch attempts to broker a truce, but Suzaku is distraught over the death of Euphemia and refuses to listen. An angered Lelouch draws his pistol and both Lelouch and Suzaku attempt to shoot one another. A single gunshot is heard as the screen fades to black at the end of the first season.

Season Two:

One year later, Lelouch is living a peaceful life with his younger brother, Rolo Lamperouge, and has no memory of his revolutionary activities, his Geass, Nunnally, his mother, or his royal lineage. Flashbacks reveal that neither Suzaku or Lelouch managed to kill one another. Instead, Lelouch was apprehended and brought before the Emperor, who used his own Geass to wipe Lelouch's memories and suppress his power. Lelouch's memories and Geass are restored by C.C., and he resumes leadership of the Black Knights. To prevent retaliation by the Britannian forces, he makes his base in the Chinese Federation's consulate. When Nunnally is appointed as Viceroy of Area 11, and announces her plans to reestablish the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, Lelouch falls into depression since he would be impeding her wishes by continuing his rebellion. He nearly begins taking Refrain before Kallen stops him. With the help of Kallen and his friends at the Ashford Academy, Lelouch realizes that his mission no longer revolves solely around Nunnally, but concerns the rest of his friends, and the Japanese people as well. To solve both concerns, Lelouch engineers the legal exile of the Black Knights by getting the Britannians to agree to exile Zero in exchange for bringing one million participants for Nunnally's new Japan. By having them all dress as Zero, he forces Suzaku to exile them all rather than order a massacre. Sayoko stays behind as his body double to keep up the illusion that Lelouch and Zero are separate people, though during her short tenure as his impersonator she changes his image into that of an athletic womanizer. The Black Knights escape to the Chinese Federation, where Lelouch begins his plans to win more countries to his side, creating a alliance that can match the Britannian Empire. He starts by overthrowing the High Eunuchs of the Chinese Federation and returning control to Empress Tianzi. He also has a secondary motive in doing so: the Chinese Federation is where V.V.'s Geass Directorate is headquartered. By taking control of the directorate, Lelouch believes he will be able to match the Emperor in both military and Geass might. While the remaining dissident forces are cleaned up, Lelouch returns to Japan to prepare for the invasion by installing Gefjun Disturbers in the mass transit rail system. The combined effect of every train running a Disturber would shut down Tokyo Settlement completely. After Shirley is killed by Rolo, Lelouch abandons his plan to take over the Geass Directorate, instead mounting an all-out assault on their stronghold. He orders the deaths of everyone within, resulting in the death of General Bartley among countless others. V.V. tries to use the Siegfried to buy time for the remaining members to escape, but it is destroyed with the aid of Cornelia while C.C. annihilates the remaining followers. Lelouch chases V.V. back into the temple, where he is unexpectedly teleported to the Sword of Akasha to face the Emperor. Lelouch attempts to kill the Emperor, but he has become immortal like C.C. The Emperor tells Lelouch about the world's lies, and shortly after C.C. arrives, finally revealing the contents of their pact. She would have had Lelouch kill her and take on her immortality, but instead spares him by placing him inside her memories while the Emperor kills her. Lelouch refuses to let her die unhappy and convinces her to live on. Lelouch destroys part of the Sword of Akasha and is transported back to the real world with C.C., but her memories of her life after gaining Geass have been erased. Lelouch then completes ratifying the United Federation of Nations, and their first act is to liberate Japan. To insure Nunnally's safety, Lelouch agrees to meet Suzaku alone at the Kururugi Shrine. Suzaku demands answers about Lelouch's various uses of Geass, but Lelouch lies, claiming that everything he has ever done was purely for selfish reasons. Suzaku realizes that Lelouch is lying and agrees to help, but Prince Schneizel's troops move in to arrest Lelouch, convincing him that Suzaku sold him out. Lelouch escapes with the help of Guilford, having used his Geass to make Guilford see him as Princess Cornelia, and uses the Gefjun Disturber trains to shut down Tokyo Settlement. He resolves to abandon his emotions in order to achieve his goals, having lost his faith in friendship. In the second battle of Tokyo, Lelouch directs his forces to focus on the government building in an effort to secure Nunnally. Suzaku threatens to use the F.L.E.I.J.A. bomb unless Lelouch stands down, but Lelouch merely waves him off as a liar. Once Kallen escapes in her upgraded Guren and Suzaku becomes an obstacle, Lelouch orders her to kill him. As her Knightmare is far more advanced, she nearly succeeds. Suzaku's imminent defeat activates his Geass command, causing him to launch F.L.E.I.J.A. The bomb engulfs the government complex, killing Nunnally among countless others. Lelouch goes into a nervous breakdown at the thought, refusing to believe that Nunnally could be dead. His identity is then exposed by Schneizel and the Black Knights betray him. Rolo evacuates him, but dies in the attempt. In the end, Lelouch comes to terms with his feelings for Rolo. Having lost everything as retribution for his acts, he realizes that the last thing he must do is drag his father into hell with him. With his renewed purpose, Lelouch quickly sets off to defeat the Emperor, throwing the Britannian ranks into chaos by using his Geass to make numerous soldiers slaves to his will. As the Britannian forces battle one another, Lelouch confronts the Emperor in the Sword of Akasha, sealing the entrance behind him so they will both be trapped for eternity.

Geass:
Lelouch's Geass, given to him by C.C., grants him ""the power of absolute obedience,"" allowing him to plant commands within a person's mind upon eye contact which they will obey without question. Activation of his Geass is visually represented by the manifestation of a Geass sigil in his left eye. Commands dictated in this state are written into the minds of the designated targets once the sigil projects from his eye to theirs. Lelouch could initially toggle Geass activation at will, but subsequently loses this control to an affliction known as Geass runaway.


In the second season, C.C. gives Lelouch a contact lens that blocks his Geass, but indicates that his Geass will eventually grow powerful enough to render it ineffective.
Of all the Geass abilities in the series, Lelouch's has been explored the most, and also seems to have the most restrictions and side effects of any Geass introduced.

* Commands must be issued verbally.
* The victim must make direct eye contact for commands to be issued. The maximum effective distance is 270 meters. Line of sight via a reflective surface is sufficient for the effect to occur.
* Commands may be issued only once to any given individual, but any number of commands may be issued at initial application so long as eye contact is unbroken. Since Jeremiah's Geass Canceller negates all Geass effects, those exposed to it may be commanded once again.
* The victim will not perform any action disallowed by their physical or mental capabilities, though they will try to carry out the command to the best of their ability. For example, a victim will not be able to correctly answer a question they don't know the answer to, but will direct the user to someone who can if they are able. However, commands that affect the mind or consciousness, such as telling the victim to forget something, will take effect despite the fact that the victim could not normally force themselves to do so.
* An action will be carried out for as long as dictated in its command, or upon the indicated conditional circumstance. Eye contact does not need to be maintained for command execution to occur. No upper limit has been established, but the conditional command Lelouch gives Suzaku is still in effect more than a year later.
* The victim's memories for the duration of command issue and execution are sealed and cannot be recalled.
* A victim may resist a commanded action to some degree if it is utterly repugnant to them.

So long as the above conditions are met, commands may be issued to anybody besides those who have gained the power of immortality and to any number of individuals at once. Those under the effect of Geass have a red outline on their pupils, presumably a visual cue for the viewer since the characters never point it out.

Even without his Geass, Lelouch is a formidable opponent. He is highly intelligent, possessing a genius-level intellect, and is capable of devising and executing strategies with incredible speed and precision. Rolo notes that operating the Absolute Defense Territory of the Shinkirō requires complex calculations which he cannot perform, while Lelouch almost makes it look easy. In the audio dramas, Suzaku says that, when they were children, Lelouch devised a secret sign language containing over 500 words.

Lelouch is quick to deduce facts from simple clues. In episode 14, when Mao says C.C.'s name, Lelouch instantly comes up with fourteen different possibilities for Mao's identity, including the correct one. Lelouch is also able to predict the Lancelot's actions exactly through his study of their past battles, allowing Kallen and the Four Holy Swords to almost defeat it (only Suzaku's reflexes saved his life).

Lelouch is also charismatic and persuasive; as Zero, he is able to win the support of much of Japan's population through well-delivered speeches combined with his ability to make miracles in almost any situation through his superior tactical planning. Mao repeatedly praises Lelouch's persuasive talent, and V.V. remarks that Lelouch is ""a lot like his father.""

Physically, Lelouch is underwhelming. He possesses the physical prowess of a teenager who engages in little to no strenuous physical activity. Thus, one of Lelouch's traits is the inability to run very fast or for any substantial period of time. Within the series, this is usually played for comedic effect, as Lelouch is constantly outpaced by his classmates in every situation, and even the most simple tasks requiring manual labor exhaust him before he manages to accomplish anything significant. This joke is taken to its logical conclusion in the second season, where it is revealed that Lelouch is supposed to attend remedial physical education classes, but skips them as often as possible. This creates problems when Sayoko poses as Lelouch: she is a master of martial arts, and hence far more athletic than Lelouch himself. Lelouch laments the problem and decides to have Sayoko attend his gym classes to fix it.

Lelouch is also shown to be very talented at most domestic skills, including cooking and sewing; it has been stated that this comes as a result of his taking care of himself and Nunnally for seven years. He has been shown to be an excellent cook, and is usually the one cooking the food for parties held by the Student Council, both because the others (except Milly) are terrible cooks and nobody else can meet his exacting requirements (such as measuring ingredients to three significant decimals).

Lelouch also has some skill with firearms, usually brandishing a Britannian pistol when threatening someone. His Knightmare piloting skill has been shown to be proficient but not exceptional; he is a capable pilot by himself, though he tends to be overwhelmed by Suzaku and other pilots with more advanced Knightmares at their disposal. When Lelouch pilots a standard Knightmare on the battlefield, he is typically accompanied by Kallen, who is an elite Knightmare pilot and the leader of his personal squad, Squad Zero.


After stealing the Gawain, Lelouch co-pilots it with C.C., controlling the weapons and command functions while C.C. handles navigation and flight. After the Black Knights are exiled from Japan, Lelouch pilots the Shinkirō, which has the most powerful defense of any Knightmare. At the end of season 2, Lelouch ordered Suzaku to kill him so that his sins and all the people's hatred will disappear and he will be free. Killing him will be a key to future happiness."

C.C. is apparently immortal, healing from any wound (implied to include beheading) with enough time. She also doesn't age. Apart from her immortality, C.C. has the ability to bestow people with the power of Geass, which manifests differently in each person but generally carries the ability to affect the minds of those it is used on in some way. The Geass sigil glows on her forehead whenever she manifests this power, and she has a similar scar on her left breast. It is hinted that many more like her exist, as shown in her memories of many children with similar sigils, and she suggests that the power has precipitated bloody conflicts in the past. Her powers caught the interest of Britannia, who imprisoned her for experimentation purposes.


Before she gained the power of Geass, C.C. was a ten-year old escaped slave. A church nun gave C.C. the power of Geass, making everyone around her fall in love with her. Once C.C.'s power evolved to its highest point and she grew tired of all the proposals and gifts, the nun transferred her immortality to C.C., allowing her to die while leaving C.C. in the position of repeating the cycle. In the first season finale, C.C. triggers a trap set by V.V., causing herself and Lelouch to be submerged in a shock image sequence similar to the one she used on Suzaku. Through this, Lelouch sees memories of her past, including repeated ""deaths"". One shows C.C. attempting to escape from a battlefield, only to be shot in the forehead. Further memories show her being persecuted as a witch and suffering various forms of torture and/or execution throughout history and various time periods, including burning at the stake, guillotining, and the iron maiden. This would suggest a minimum lifespan of at least six centuries. In a special feature included in the series' fifth DVD, she and Lelouch discuss Washington's Rebellion, during which she speaks of participants such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin as if she had been close friends with both. In the past, she appears to have observed Suzaku and Lelouch when they were both children, having even interacted with Lelouch at one point, though he doesn't remember their meeting.
Her individual experiences have led C.C. to become a detached and lonely individual, with little care for even those she has entered into contracts with, while in the past she was somewhat a spoiled and cheerful girl. She tells Lelouch that she has been alive so long that she can no longer remember who loves her and who hates her. Due to her nature and history, she has been lonely as long as she can remember. Lelouch replies, ""You're not alone. We are partners. If you are a witch, then I shall become a demon."" Lelouch is possibly the first person that has ever truly cared for her and it appears that she reciprocates at least some of these feelings, as she unexpectedly kisses him after their memories are shared.

C.C. has a strong penchant for pizza, especially Pizza Hut's (which sponsors the show in Japan, though the logo is blurred out in the English dub); she constantly orders pizzas to Lelouch's house using his credit card. She also carries around a stuffed toy of ""Cheese-kun"", the company's mascot in Japan. Her love of pizza is often used for comedic effect, as she was twice willing to risk capture simply to get a piece of a giant pizza being made by the Student Council (which is ruined both times); she doesn't trust Lelouch to retrieve it for her. Both Lelouch and Kallen sometimes refer to her as ""Pizza Girl.""


When left alone, she has sometimes spoken to a previously unknown person through means unknown, which, in episode 23, was revealed to be Marianne, Lelouch's deceased mother, although in episode 19 it appears that she is talking to V.V. as well. According to the DVD Magazine 02, she is talking to more than one person when she seems to be talking to herself. In the past, it was shown that she and Marianne were close."

Zodiac Sign:
Aries

Blood Type:
B

Height:
173 cm (5'8"")

Birth date:
March 29, 2000

A Britannian-Eleven girl, who believes herself to be a Japanese person at heart. Before the Britannia Empire conquered Area 11, Kallen's original name was Karen Kouzuki. She comes from a prestigious family and attends the Ashford Academy where she receives outstanding grades while serving as a member of its Student Council. When away from the Academy, she fights as an anti-Britannian operative. Also, Kallen helped organize the Black Knights.

Her brother, Naoto Kouzuki, with whom she had a deep connection, was a former leader of her resistance cell before his death.

Both Kallen's stepmother, a Britannian, and biological mother live with her in the same house, but her biological mother is employed as a maid and is often mistreated by both her stepmother and Kallen herself. After her biological mother is arrested for using Refrain (a fictional drug which lets people think they're reliving the past), Kallen changes her views and decides to fight against the Britannian Empire not only for her brother, but to fulfill her new wish for a world in which she can live happily with her biological mother.

Frail and meek, this aspect of Kallen's character was used as a public front to mask her true nature as well as hide her involvement in the resistance.

Kallen leads a double life as a normal Britannian student and as a member of a guerrilla resistance group against Britannia, which is later reformed into the Order of the Black Knights by Lelouch Lamperouge. In school, she portrays herself as a weak-bodied high school student who obeys all of the formalities, and goes by her Britannian name of Stadtfeld. However, her personality changes in to a very strong-willed and forceful one when she acts as a resistance fighter.

As a running gag, Kallen ends up nude or immodestly dressed in front of other people on numerous occasions: Lelouch sees her naked after she pulls back a shower curtain in surprise in the third episode, Suzaku sees her bathing under a waterfall when they are stranded on Kaminejima, she is forced to dress in an immodest bunny costume at the start of the second season (to plant a tracking device on Lelouch), and she walks in on a meeting between C.C. and the Chinese ambassadors wearing only a towel when intending to complain about the previous situation to C.C. (claiming that the operation would've gone faster if C.C. was wearing the outfit).

In an interview reported by the anime magazine Newtype USA, seiyu Ami Koshimizu talked about the difficulty of voicing Kallen because of the double life that her character leads. Certain aspects of Kallen's character such as her girlish naivete and competitiveness made it easy for the voice actress to relate, even to the point of admitting that in some ways they act very much the same."

Lelouch's childhood friend and son of Japan's last prime minister. After Britannia's takeover of Japan, Suzaku joins the Britannia Army and becomes an Honorary Britannian. He agrees with Zero (Lelouch in disguise, unknown to Suzaku) with his assertion that the Britannia Empire is not worth serving, but nevertheless wishes to implement changes and improvements from within the empire, all the while trying not to lose sight of his goals lest his father's death have been in vain. He has a strong sense of justice and is the only one known to be able to pilot the elite Britannian Knightmare Frame, Lancelot. He always keeps with him a broken pocket watch, a memento of his deceased father.


He is in love with Euphemia and is devastated upon her death. He swears revenge against Zero, for killing her. In the last episode of R2, Lelouch asks Suzaku to kill him (as all of the world's hatred is now focused upon him) and to become Zero. Suzaku kills Lelouch in front of all the Black Knights and Nunnally at a parade held for Lelouch. After Lelouch dies, Suzaku takes care of Nunnally as Zero and leads the Black Knights.

An elite Knightmare Frame pilot and a Purist, who is deeply concerned with the Purists' supremacy - enough to use Suzaku as a scapegoat for both avenging Clovis' death and reinforcing the Purists' superiority in Area 11. Initially, he held the rank of Margrave in Area 11's military hierarchy. After Clovis' murder, Jeremiah takes upon the role of Area 11's Acting-Consul, but upon the Zero fiasco, Jeremiah falls into disgrace (due to his incomprehensible actions caused by Lelouch's geass), is targeted for termination by his fellow Purist officers, demoted to the rank of a mere Knightmare Frame pilot and referred mockingly as Orange or Orange-Kun by both his superiors and his fellow knightmare pilots.


In the second season he came back as a machine-like man having the ability to use Geass Canceller. At the end of episode 13 it is seen that he joins Zero's side after revealing that on the day Empress Marianne was killed, he attempted to rescue her but failed. He came back as a member of the Knightmare Frame pilot to atone for his inability to rescue her.

Once Zero Requiem was completed, Jeremiah and Anya start a new life on an orange farm, supposedly a pun for his name.

Date of Birth: July 9 as family (July 8 as real birthday)
Blood Type: A
Height: 175 cm (5'9"")

Shirley Fenette is a typical, all-around nice girl who is exceptionally friendly and loves her friends. She is a member of the swimming club. She admits to being infatuated with Lelouch since his enrollment on campus, but finds it extremely hard to get his attention. She has a habit of jumping to conclusions before people can explain things to her, particularly when Lelouch is concerned. Shirley was awarded 19th place in the 29th Anime Grand Prix for Favorite Female Character.


Shirley has a major role in the middle of the first season. After the Black Knights, led by Lelouch's alter ego Zero, indirectly cause the death of her father during the Battle of Narita, Villetta Nu suggests that Lelouch may be involved with the Black Knights, so Shirley follows him and discovers that he is in fact Zero. When Villetta covertly follows her and attempts to arrest Lelouch, Shirley shoots her to protect him. She tries to write a letter about her feelings on the situation to Lelouch, only to throw it aside. Mao uses his mind-reading Geass to manipulate her into killing Lelouch, but she cannot bring herself to do so. To alleviate her suffering, Lelouch uses his Geass to erase Shirley's memories of him. Lelouch expresses regret for having to do so, and even quietly suggests that he might have loved her. Shirley rediscovers her letter near the end of the first season, but cannot confront Lelouch about it because of the rebellion that takes place. In the second season, Shirley's memories, along with the rest of Ashford's Student Council, have been rewritten by the Emperor, erasing her memories of Zero's identity for the second time. Her affection for Lelouch has returned over the intermidiate year. Her memories are restored by Jeremiah Gottwald's Geass Canceller. After coming to terms with it, she comes to understand Lelouch's motivations and forgives him after realizing that he is alone in his quest. She resolves to support him as the one true thing in his life, but runs into Rolo; when she mentions that she wants to help Lelouch reunite with Nunnally, he mortally wounds her. She confesses her feelings to Lelouch when he finds her, and dies in his arms despite Lelouch's desperate attempts to command her to live. Her death was officially ruled as a suicide by a coroner."

Lloyd Asplund is an earl of the Britannian nobility and the developer of the elite Knightmare Frame Lancelot. To keep from being reminded of the fragility of human lives and friendship, Lloyd immerses himself in science and has come to view people as nothing more than tools — he regards Suzaku, for example, as a mere component of the machine that he pilots. He has a tendency to mock others and is often rebuked for this behavior by Cécile Croomy, his assistant. Prior to joining the military, he attended the Imperial Colchester Institute. Lloyd's research organization, Camelot is an irregular division of the Britannian Military and has been granted permission by Prince Schneizel to operate outside the command structure and regulations of the regular Britannian armed forces.

Rakshata refers to Lloyd as the Earl of Pudding, as pudding is his favorite food.
He is engaged to wed Milly Ashford in the first season, having agreed to the union mostly in hope that he might obtain the designs of the Knightmare Frame Ganymede. As such, he is forced into doing nice things for her by Suzaku, though Milly breaks off the engagement after she graduates."

Age: 16
Birthday: October 25
Height: 170.5 cm
Weight: 51 kg

Rolo is introduced in the second season as Lelouch's younger brother,
but is actually an assassin placed there by the Britannian Emperor under orders to kill him should he ever recover any memories of being Zero.

Rolo is unsociable and reserved, unlike his older brother, a trait which does not gain him many friends at school. While working with the Britannian Secret Intelligence Service, he is aloof and doesn't seem very interested. He often stays in the background and simply listens and isn't afraid to be very blunt about their faults. While Rolo puts up a front of being withdrawn, this exterior hides a ruthless and detached killer who will do whatever it takes to complete his mission.

Despite his attitude towards the mission, Rolo is devoted to Lelouch. Lelouch's year without memories show him and Rolo quite happy, particularly when Lelouch gives him a heart-shaped musical locket as a birthday present, which he keeps attached to his cellphone. His attachment to the locket is such that he refuses to return it even when Lelouch tries to reclaim it. It is also clear that he has also been heavily affected by his time with Lelouch. Because of this, he is easily manipulated into believing that Lelouch cares for him and thus follows his orders without question."

Height: 160 cm (5'3"") - 164 cm (5'4"")

Nunnally vi Britannia is a royal princess born to the Emperor of Britannia, Charles Di Britannia, and Marianne Vi Britannia. She was 87th in line of succession to the Britannia Throne before she and her brother were exiled to Japan as political prisoners. She is Lelouch's younger sister who is wheelchair-bound due to old bullet wounds on her legs, and blind due to psychological trauma while witnessing the brutal murder of her mother, Marianne Vi Britannia. Lelouch believes that she may be able to see again someday. After the confrontation of Lelouch with the Emperor of Britannia about the murder of their mother, both Lelouch and Nunnally were sent to Japan as political trade. They then went on to live in Kururugi Residence where she first met Suzaku Kururugi.

After Britannia invades Japan, Lelouch hides their identity in fear of their safety and changes their surname to Lamperouge. They then seek help from Marianne's old allies, the Ashford family, who kept their identity a secret and allows the two siblings to live in a building on campus to accommodate her disabilities. Nunnally attends Ashford Academy's middle school and is friends with Lelouch's classmates, particularly with Shirley. She is very kindhearted and calls the Elevens ""Japanese people.""

She is also the reason why Lelouch wants to revolt against Britannia. Lelouch wants to build a better world for Nunnally. In episode 24, despite the fact that the The Black Knights were on the verge of winning, Lelouch abandons them to rescue Nunnally after learning of her being kidnapped by V.V.


In the beginning of R2, it seems that nobody at Ashford Academy remembers her existence; everyone apparently recognizes that Lelouch has a younger brother, Rolo, instead of Nunnally. After recovering his memory, Lelouch deduces that Nunnally is likely being held hostage by the Emperor, who would not hesitate to use his children to achieve his goals. As a result, Lelouch must try to maintain the masquerade that he has not regained his memories in order to protect her.


Nunnally makes her first appearances in episode 5 of R2, revealing that she still recalls who Lelouch is, addressing him as her older brother, and shocks Lelouch with the revelation that she has been assigned to become the new Governor-General of Area 11. Nunnally discloses her own decision to become Governor of Area 11. Much to the shock of Lelouch, she decides to continue her late sister Princess Euphemia's will by reinstating the Special Administrative Region in Japan, sharing her and Suzaku's belief that the world can be changed in gentle ways. Currently, however, Nunnally has yet to know of the true identity of Zero and the existence of the Geass, but she heard Lelouch's voice when the ship exploded alluding to the possibility that she does. Her Imperial Name and status was also restored."

Regu;Regu  (レグ);Regu  ;"
Regu is a robot who appears to be a little boy. His actual age, origins and even name are unknown since he can't recall anything about his life before the encounter with Riko. He was named Regu by Riko after a dog she used to have.

Regu's body is extremely durable and resistant to physical damage, it's also way lighter than its size would suggest. The arms could be extended for as far as 40 meters and each of them has a built-in Incinerator relic. These high-powered beam cannons are capable of reducing to ashes almost anything, however, Incinerators are weapons of last resort since even a single shot depletes the body's energy almost completely making Regu lose consciousness for 2 hours. Having an artificial body, Regu might be the only intelligent being completely immune to the Curse of the Abyss, because of that he is sometimes referred to as ""The Aubade"" aka ""The Treasure of the Deep.""

Despite being a formidable fighter Regu is rather shy and unassertive. He blushes easily and often cries when in distress. Unlike Riko, Regu is easily flustered by danger and has to rely on Riko's judgment in difficult situations.

Riko;Riko  (リコ);Riko  ;"
Riko is the only child of the legendary cave raider Lyza ""The Annihilator."" When Riko was two, her mother went missing during a quest to the bottom of the Abyss, since then Riko lived in Beruchoro Orphanage, studying to become a cave raider herself.

By the age of twelve she's attained the rank of an apprentice which gives her rights to wear a red whistle and explore the shallowest levels of the Abyss. She dreams of attaining the white whistle rank (the highest among cave raiders) and following her mother to the bottom of the Abyss.

Riko is a good-natured and energetic child. She has a quick and inquisitive mind and tries to gather and properly organize all the information available on the subjects that interest her. Riko is resilient and stubborn and although, due to the slight build, she's not much of a brawler, her ability to keep a cool head under pressure and make rational decisions in the heat of battle allows her to successfully tackle most dangers the Abyss has to offer. She's also very good at cooking.

Nanachi is so-called ""Final Form""—a survivor of ascension from the sixth level of the Abyss. Madness and/or death are not uncommon results of such an attempt but, due to certain circumstances, Nanachi was able to keep their personality and mental faculties intact, their body, however, was deformed beyond recognition.

Nanachi is presumed to be female, although their sex is never expressly stated and talking about themself Nanachi uses gender-neutral pronoun ""oira.""

Not much is known about Nanachi's past—they were born in the Far North region of Sereni, lost their family and home at a young age and were taken to the Abyss by treachery.

Nanachi looks very young, but their vast knowledge of the physics and ecology of the Abyss seems to suggest they've lived there for quite a while. They also appear to be an accomplished healer with significant surgical skills and extensive knowledge of medicinal plants and such. Most of the time Nanachi is cool and reserved, keeping their distance both emotionally and physically. Their ironic attitude often borders on being sarcastic and even cynical, however behind this mask Nanachi hides a kind and gentle soul capable of deep compassion and selfless devotion.

Ouzen ""The Immovable Lord"" is a holder of the elite White Whistle rank who lives at the Observation Base on the second level of the Abyss where she commands a small team of cave raiders known as ""The Layabouts."" Ouzen was a mentor and a close friend of Riko's mother Lyza.

Ouzen is a peerless fighter—her unique relic ""Thousand Pins"" grants her superhuman strength, speed, and longevity. (Even though Ouzen appears to be young, she attained the rank of a white whistle more than 50 years back.) She is over two meters tall and has a peculiar hairstyle which conceals the scalp deformations caused by the extended exposure to the Curse of the Abyss.

Ouzen has absolute control over her facial expressions, and her actual feelings (or lack thereof) cannot be guessed with any certainty. The reasons behind her actions are unknown as well—Ouzen rarely bothers to explain herself, and even when she does, it's impossible to know whether she's telling the truth or just toying with the audience.

Maruruk is a Delver that lives in ""Seeker Camp"" of the 2nd layer of The Abyss alongside the legendary white whistle Ouzen the Immovable. Despite his young age, he's already a Blue Whistle due to being a direct apprentice of a White Whistle.

At some point when he was very young he fell down on an accident and nearly lost his life before being rescued by Ouzen. Following the event, he chose to stay in the abyss and become Ouzen's disciple but after some time his eyes developed an extreme sensitivity to the light, so he never returned to the surface. He's in charge of the telescope on the camp, and is often keeping watch of the surroundings in case a delver shows up so that a gondola can be lowered ahead of time.

Maruruk is a young boy with short blue hair and a rounded face. His feminine traits and maid attire leads people to mistake him for a girl but he's actually male. While the details are not clear, it seems Ouzen was the one that forced him to dress like a maid.

When the children break the rules or behave unruly, Jiruo will knock them on the top of the head to put them back in line.

No Face is a lonely being who seems to sustain itself on the emotions of those he encounters, particularly their emotional reception to his gifts. He is helpful to Chihiro because she helped him, whereas after observing the bathhouse staff's reaction to gold and his own attempts to win them over with more gold, he reacts to their greed by becoming a grotesque monster which eats lots of food and some of the staff. He calms down and reverts to his former state after he leaves the bathhouse's influence. At the end, he stays with Zeniba as a helper.

Susuwatari (ススワタリ lit. meaning ""travelling soot"") are the ""dust bunnies"" or ""soot sprites"" first featured in My Neighbor Totoro as shy, slightly frightful creatures that live in abandoned buildings such as houses. They later reappeared in Spirited Away as workers in Kamaji's boiler room. They are small, black as soot and apparently fuzzy, with spherical bodies and two inquisitive eyes. They move by hovering around, but they can extend stick-like legs and arms from their bodies to do certain tasks, and can lift objects many times heavier than their own weight. They make a squeaky murmuring sound when excited, and dissolve into powder (soot) if crushed.

In My Neighbour Totoro, the house the main characters move into is full of Susuwatari, which are rationalized as Makkuro Kurosuke (pitch-black blackie), an optical illusion caused by moving quickly from light into darkness. Later, the family drives the Susuwatari out of the house, as the home that was once abandoned is now inhabited. They would move to another abandoned area.

In Spirited Away, the protagonist Sen (Chihiro) befriends a number of them by helping them carry coal. Sen is told that if these Susuwatari aren't given a job to do, they turn back into soot. Another character, Lin, feeds the Susuwatari much like farmers feed chickens, throwing handfuls of the Japanese candy Kompeito onto the ground for them to eat.

Favorite quote:
""Then and now, what I protect has never changed.""
Occupation: Yorozuya/Odd Jobs

Gintoki is a samurai living in an era when samurai are no longer needed. To add to his troubles, oppressive aliens have moved in to invade planet Earth. Gintoki works taking on odd jobs alongside two kids: Kagura and Shinpachi. In the Joui war, he was known as the ""White Devil"" (Shiroyasha) due to his silver hair and white clothing he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear in the hearts of the Amanto.

Gintoki has naturally permed silver hair, which he blames for his lacking love-life. He has a big crush on the TV's news weather girl, Ketsuno. In fact, to date, the only time he is seen to have blushed is when he tries to make use of Sadaharu and Ketsuno's dog to get a chance to talk to her.(Though he later does with Tsukuyo as well when she discovers him shopping) Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response and merely puts up with them as annoyances.

Gintoki has two major obsessions in life. He is obsessed with sweet food such as parfaits, ice cream and cakes. His second obsession is reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Shounen Jump. (Which, not coincidentally, is where Gintama is published). Gintoki will go to great lengths to get the latest Jump issue, to the point of reckless behavior. His Jump obsession makes him dream of being like other Jump heroes, including wishing that he had a ""Bankai"" similar to the characters of Bleach.

Despite his appearance and initial behavior, Gintoki has a great amount of pride for the old bushido code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he's barely acquainted with, be it a pit-fighter who was taking care of abandoned orphans or an Amanto who resembles a kappa.

Despite being a fearsome fighter with nearly unmatched skills, he avoids needless bloodshed after suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joui war.

Kagura;Kagura  (神楽);"Kagura ""Gura, China Girl, Leader, Gurako"" ";"
Age: 14
Birthday: November 3
Zodiac: Scorpio
Height: 155 cm
Weight: 40 kg

Kagura, meaning ""god-entertainment"" is a member of the Yorozuya alongside Sakata Gintoki and Shinpachi Shimura and the main female protagonist of Gintama.

Although she appears to be a normal, cute, human girl in Chinese-style clothing, she actually belongs to the Yato Clan, one of the strongest and most bloodthirsty of the Amanto races. The Yato people are said to have ""transparent"" skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan's weapon of choice; Kagura's is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motor-scooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise by her hands.

She is also extremely flexible and fast; capable of catching multiple speeding bullets between her teeth and fingers. During battle, she's often seen flipping through the air and performing various acrobatic feats. Due to her Yato blood, she is capable of rapid regeneration. During the Benizakura arc, she is seen healing from a gunshot wound almost overnight.

Kagura also has an unusually strong appetite. She is able to consume large quantities of food within a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, her tastes are endearingly plain. Sukonbu, rice, and eggs are among her favorite foods.

Her immediate family consists of her father, Umibouzu, a widely recognized alien hunter, her mother, who is deceased, and her older brother Kamui, once presumed missing who is now involved with the space pirates Harusame.

She came to Earth to earn money for her family. She found work fighting for a gang, but when they ordered her to kill her target, she ran away. Not long afterward, she met Gintoki and Shinpachi when Gintoki accidentally ran her down with his scooter. After they helped her to make a clean break from the gang, she intimidated Gintoki into hiring her. She now lives at the Yorozuya and sleeps in Gintoki's closet, like Doraemon.

Kagura and Gintoki share an odd brother-younger sister-like relationship. Together with Shinpachi, the three of them makes for a strange, dysfunctional, yet tightly knit family. Kagura is very protective of Gintoki. Although she herself has gotten into many fights with him, she rarely lets anyone else pick on him. She seems to trust wholeheartedly in Gintoki's ability and strength. Even in sticky situations, she has no doubt that Gin-chan would come and save her. She has a tendency to imitate Gintoki's bad habits (like picking her nose or swearing, hence her unladylike behavior) and would often quote the bad advice he gives her. Some of her lines start with ""Gin-chan says..."" or ""Gin-chan told me...""

Kagura is also somewhat of a tomboy. She is often seen partaking in games with various neighborhood boys. Although her candid manner of speech often causes them to shun her, she doesn't seem to mind. In fact, she has no problem at all with forcing her way into their game. In battle, she has proven to be bull-headed and a sore loser. Like Gintoki, and probably because of his influence, she is not above resorting to petty tricks and manipulation to get the better of her adversary. Unlike many conventional manga heroines, she doesn't display the same consciousness toward decorum, table manners, and physical appearance. Puking, cussing, picking her nose, spitting, fighting, and scratching herself are common behavior for Kagura.

She regards Okita, captain of the Shinsengumi, as a rival. She detests him and appeared to be disgusted when she previously mentioned (about Okita), that ""he definitely likes me,"" but as that hasn't been brought up since, it is uncertain on if it should be considered canon, that he apparently likes her.

Although Kagura usually teases Shinpachi, she deeply cares for him and thinks of him as a brother. She also shows great respect toward his older sister, Shimura Tae, often calling her ""Anego"" (a term gangster women use to show respect).

Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu (being her 27th pet), have met with an untimely demise by her hands (with the exception of Sadaharu 28,' a beetle killed by Okita). She cuddles with Sadaharu when feeling down. Kagura also seems to be the only one (aside from Ane, Mone, and Komako) who Sadaharu listens to.

According to the OVA, Kagura is the first and only Weekly Shonen Jump girl to vomit on-screen. To date, she has induced herself to vomit on several occasions. She also has an uncanny knack for seeming calm or detached during high-tension situations; in episode 5, she slept through a car-chase. Her appetite knows no bounds, and she is especially fond of sukonbu.

In Japanese, Kagura speaks in a stereotypical dialect that is associated with Chinese immigrants. In the English-translated manga, she punctuates her sentences with yup, uh-huh (aru), nope, and the like.


In the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura meets her older brother, Kamui who abandoned her because she was weak in his eyes. During the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura and Shinpachi teamed up against a Yato veteran named Abuto. When Shinpachi was mortally wounded by Abuto, Kagura can no longer hold against her Yato blood and revealed her true inner killing instincts against Abuto. Abuto is easily overwhelmed by Kagura's true power.
In the last Gintama character popularity poll, she came in the 6th place."

Age: 16

Shinpachi Shimura works under Gintoki to learn the ways of the samurai. He used to stay at his family's dōjo. However, it seems more like he's just trying to help Gintoki pay the rent than to learn. Shinpachi is the captain of the ""Otsu's Imperial Guard,"" a pop-singer's fan club.

Shinpachi meets Gintoki after Shinpachi was tripped by the ambassador of Planet Chatoran. Gintoki beats up the ambassador and his guards, not to stand up for Shinpachi, but to get revenge for his spilled parfait. Gintoki frames Shinpachi for the crime, which somehow led to him saving Shimura Tae (Otae), Shinpachi's sister, from becoming part of a brothel.

Despite his meek appearance, Shinpachi is a more than competent swordsman of his family's Kakidō-Ryu, the type of swordmanship his dojo teaches.

In the character popularity poll, he was in 8th place.

His name is roughly based on Shinsengumi member Nagakura Shinpachi and comedian Ken Shimura."

Hijikata is the famed chain smoking, vice commander of the Shinsengumi so named by his subordinates, because of his fearsome demeanor. Purportedly the brains behind the force, he takes his work seriously, and is fiercely loyal to his leader, Isao Kondo.

Hijikata has a reputation as a fearsome leader, earning the nickname of ""demonic vice-commander."" He is also hot-tempered and often speaks of seppuku. However, despite his cold exterior, he does have a more compassionate side. He also has a tendency to cry after watching movies that are not particularly emotional.

Hijikata is obsessed with mayonnaise and thus has the nickname ""Mayora."" He has been known to smother anything he eats under a mountain of mayonnaise, and he carries a number of objects shaped like jars of mayonnaise, such as his cigarette lighter. He was popular with girls until they discovered this obsession.

He enjoys fighting and sees Gintoki as a rival in practically everything he does from drinking contests to rock, paper, scissors ever since being defeated by him in battle. He is in constant danger of being killed by the attempts on his life by Okita. But, despite all this, he sees Okita as one of his close friends, and vice versa.

Before joining Shinsengumi, he used to be a trouble-maker ronin. He enjoys fighting/having a good fight and says he doesn't care how many Amanto buildings get blown up, he only looks forward to having a big battle with the Joui rebels after Shinsengumi has rounded them in 1 fell swoop, in Episode 5.

He also formulated the Kyokuchuu Hatto, the 45 Regulations that form the disciplinary framework for Shinsengumi members, and implements them firmly.

Occupation: First Division Captain Shinsengumi

Okita is the best swordsman in the Shinsengumi. Personality-wise, he tends to be light-hearted and somewhat childish though his speech is heavily deadpan.

He outwardly displays annoyance and dislike for Hijikata, and continuously tries to harm and humiliate him whenever given the chance.


Losing his parents at a young age, he was raised by his sister, Mitsuba. Thus, although he is sadistic and violent towards other people, Okita absolutely adores his sister and does everything he can to please her. Mitsuba is one of the reasons why Okita hates Hijikata. Okita viewed Hijikata as a rival for his sister's attention. He also greatly dislikes the fact that Hijikata treated Mitsuba coldly, although Mitsuba clearly showed signs of liking Hijikata.
Okita has great affection and fondness for Kondo, who took him under his wings when he was little. He still regards Hijikata as one of his three friends (the other two being Kondo and Gintoki).

He enjoys seeing women fight, finding the ugly looks on their faces as they grab each other being hilarious. He wears a distinctive eye mask when taking a nap during duty, which is a frequent occurrence. At one point, he refers to himself as the best sniper in the Shinsengumi. Although he is a master of kenjutsu, he uses a bazooka more often.

He also regards Kagura as a rival after an unfinished rock-paper-scissors duel during a sakura-blossom party. He states that he'll ""be the only one to defeat her"", and usually calls her ""China"".

In the original Japanese manga he likes to end his sentences in ""~desaa"" and ""~desuzee.""

In Sorachi's original character design, Okita was a female, and wielded an umbrella. This concept was ultimately given to Kagura.

In the second Shounen JUMP character popularity poll, he ranked 2nd place, just below Gintoki.

In volume 12, Okita's age is revealed to be 18. Despite being under Japan's legal drinking age, in Edo, you can drink alcohol from 15.

His name is based on the historical Okita Souji."
Katsura, Kotarou;Kotarou Katsura (桂 小太郎);"Kotarou ""Zura, Fruits Punch Samurai, Zurako, Captain Katsura, Katsuo"" Katsura";"
Age: 20s
Birthday: June 26 (Cancer)
Height: 175 cm
Weight: 56 kg
Blood Type: AB

Katsura is Gintoki's former comrade during the Joi war. Even after the Amanto take-over of Japan, Katsura continues to resist the Amanto, and has amassed a band of followers. His weapon of choice is a metallic grenade. He is a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, and is constantly on the run from the Shinsengumi. Although his initial methods were originally more violent in nature (for instance, sending a bomb to an Amanto embassy), Katsura has gradually grown to believe that there are people important to him in Edo, and decides that he no longer wants to destroy the country, but believes there should be a way to change it without causing sacrifices.

Katsura seems to be highly respected by his followers, and has even been called the ""Daybreak of the Joui Faction"" by some. When people believed that Katsura had died during the Benizakura arc, even other terrorist groups tried to avenge his death.
Since he is a wanted man, Katsura is often seen wearing disguises, although his identity is often still easily found out. One example of a disguise he seems to be fond of is a pirate's costume, complete with an eyepatch (with a skull design) over his left eye and a scar on his right cheek, and using this he calls himself 'Space Captain Katsura'.

Katsura seems to possess a rather outdated sense of humour, and sometimes refers to things from a past era, such as when he tried to buy a Famicon when people were queuing up to buy the OwEe (a parody of the Wii). He also seems to have a tendency to make up dramatic stories, which moves others to tears when they hear these stories (except Gintoki).
Katsura sometimes works odd jobs (e.g. in Episode 88), to raise money for his terrorist activities. He claims that his heart has started to be moved by Ikumatsu in episode 39 (chapter 55 equivalent of the manga), and held his subsequent interview in her ramen restaurant.

In the Japanese version, Gintoki often calls him ""Zura."" In the first English volume, Gintoki calls him ""Casserole,"" or ""Cough syrup."" Eventually, the English version changed to Gintoki calling Katsura ""Zura."" In the Japanese version, Katsura indignantly replies ""Not 'Zura'! It's Katsura!"" (and will do so anytime he is called something other than his name). In the English version he replies ""Not Casserole! It's Katsura!"" The Japanese version joke is a pun, since ""Katsura"" can mean wig in Japanese and ""Zura"" is slang for the same thing. The English version is also a wordplay since ""Katsura"" and ""Casserole"" sound somewhat similar in pronunciation. He has the uncanny ability to know when someone has called him something other than Katsura, even in their head. An example being in Episode 25 as a guest to Gintoki's hotpot dinner.

His name is based on the historical Katsura Kogoro."

Zodiac: Gemini
Height: 179 cm
Weight: 67 kg

Hasegawa used to be an official working for the Bakufu, but after an unfortunate incident with Amanto dignitary Prince Hata, whom he was assigned to serve and protect, his superior asked him to succumb to his shame and commit seppuku, hearing that he ran away from his quarters.

He initially believed that humans should focus on appeasing the Amanto, but after his encounter with Gintoki, his mindset changed, which led to him punching Hata out, thus getting fired. Since then, he has been living a life of somewhat like a loser, getting fired almost every time he gets a new job, mostly due to the unfavourable look his sunglasses and goatee give him.

No matter what, he refuses to remove his sunglasses because it's the only thing he had left to remind him of his successful past. Although he does exchange the sunglasses for a decent pair of half-moon spectacles at one point, he goes back to wearing them after he decides that he is going to live out his life in the best way he can. He is constantly seen working various part-time jobs. He is often referred to as ""Madao,"" short for ""marude damena ossan,"" which roughly translates into ""totally useless middle-aged man.""

He and Gintoki are on good terms with one another and seem to spend most of their free time gambling. He often plays pachinko, but rarely ever wins. After losing his job for the Bakufu, he is seen doing odd jobs from time to time, like running a supermarket for a friend or driving a taxi at one time.

He's currently estranged from his wife Hatsu, because of his jobless lifestyle, however they still keep in touch.

It is revealed in episode 52 that he is 38 years old after he pees his pants."
Tsukuyo;Tsukuyo  (月詠);"Tsukuyo ""Tsukki, The Moon of Yoshiwara, Shinigami Tayuu"" ";"
Birthday: February 9
Height: 170 cm (5' 7"")
Weight: 52 kg (114 lb)

Tsukuyo is a blonde-haired woman with a scar over her forehead and left cheek. One of the better known Hundred Blooms of Yoshiwara, a law enforcement squad of Yoshiwara that consists of all females, deployed by the Night King Hosen. Despite appearing to be a heartless person when approached by Odd Jobs when he arrives to Yoshiwara, throwing a fake kunai to their foreheads, she later becomes friends with them. She has a difficult past being orphaned as a child, only to be picked up and raised by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. While the original motive for Jiraia was to instill every bit of despair and tragedy of his own life into Tsukuyo, of who he refers to as his art or perfect creation, Tsukuyo ended up growing attached to what he did not manage to do. That is ""Friends, A Home, and Precious Things To Protect"" as told by Jiraia. Her loyalty and home lies with Hinowa in the underground city of Yoshiwara. She has ties with Hinowa, who also helped raise her like an older sister/mother through her childhood.


It is hinted by Jiraia (in Chapter 255/Episode 178) Hinowa and Seita (in Chapter 294) that she has romantic feelings for Gintoki. This is further supported by her scribbling out statements from Hinowa's and Seita's New Year's cards commenting how lonely she was when they heard Gintoki has gotten married and her inability to give him chocolates for Valentine's Day (in Episode 204). Tsukyo herself has confirmed that, while she doesn't quite know what they are or what to do with them, she has some feelings towards Gintoki. This was in episode 177 when she said to him, ""When I am with you, my resolve weakens. Don't shake up my feelings any further.""

Takasugi, Shinsuke;Shinsuke Takasugi (高杉晋助);Shinsuke  Takasugi;"
Age: 20s
Birthday: August 10
Zodiac: Leo
Hair: Black (purple highlights)
Eyes: Light Olive Green (bandage over left eye)
Height: 170cm
Weight: 60kg
Occupation: Leader of the Kiheitai
Hobbies: Smoking a pipe, Playing a shamisen

A former comrade of Gintoki and Katsura and a major antagonist. He now leads a radical Joui faction called the Kiheitai and is known amongst the Shinsengumi as 'the most dangerous man in both the Joui faction and amongst the radicals'. He is easily recognizable through his bandaged left eye, his colorful kimono, his eerie smile, and the pipe he is often seen smoking.

He, Gintoki, and Katsura studied in the same temple elementary school when they were children, and he fought with them against the Amanto invasion during the latter part of the Joui war. After the war ended, he vanished, and has since gained a dangerous reputation due to his assassination of many of the Bakufu's main officers and his planning of a large-scale coup d'etat. Before his first appearance in both the anime and the manga, he was mentioned to have fled Edo and to have been hiding in Kyoto, although it is unclear how long before this was.

He now believes that the only way to save it is to destroy the ""rotten"" post-Joui war world.

He is shown to like festivals, although this is mainly due to the opportunity they provide for a large-scale terrorist attack: he appears to have an attraction to ruin that is almost nihilistic. He also appears to have considerable insight due to his 'seeing through Itou's heart' and subsequently planting him in the Shinsengumi's ranks.

It can be assumed that he is as skilled a swordsman as both Gintoki and Katsura, having fought alongside them as one of the 'heroes' of the Joui war. That aside, he appears to have at least considerable skill in playing the shamisen, and is shown at one point playing it with Bansai as they talk.

He is based on the historical Takasugi Shinsaku."
Elizabeth;Elizabeth  (エリザベス, 江蓮);"Elizabeth ""Eli, Shogun Ehou, Eren"" ";"
Elizabeth resembles a giant white duck or a giant penguin and is Katsura's companion. Elizabeth was a present from Tatsuma Sakamoto, who presumably picked it up on his travels around space. Although many people consider Elizabeth to be insane and extraneous, Katsura has named the ambiguous avian ""Elizabeth"" and dotes on it. Once in episode 18 Shinpachi purchased a doll named as Space Alien Stefan (宇宙怪獣ステファン) to which looks perfectly similar to Elizabeth. Elizabeth is something of a painter, and is surprisingly dexterous. Also, Elizabeth resorts to using signboards to ""communicate,"" as well as an occasional means of attack. Elizabeth is also a skilled fighter, able to use signboards to fight off swordsmen.

Although the true identity of Elizabeth is uncertain, it appears to be a man wearing a duck costume. In its first appearance, hairy legs are seen underneath her sheet and the body of a humanoid with glowing eyes is revealed as her mouth is opened just as it fell during another battle between Gintoki and Katsura. Although Katsura seems shocked at what she really is, she has subsequently remained by his side. Episode 50 implies that the person inside Elizabeth is most likely the director (Gintoki was interrupted before he can finish being cut off at ""Kanto-"" (""Direc-""). Most of the characters seem to ignore this, or at least do not give it much thought, given at the episode was completely filler. Moreover, the next time the inside of Elizabeth is shown, it reverts to the glowing eyes.

When Shinpachi boards Takasugi's ship in order to rescue Kagura, a bazooka is seen coming out of Elizabeth's mouth when she blasts the ship to distract everyone from Shinpachi. Because of this, Shinpachi refers to her as Elizabeth-senpai.

Elizabeth's birthday is September 7. ""Her"" height is 180 centimeters, and ""she"" weighs 123 kilograms.

Favorite Food: Tamago kake gohan (a meal composed of a raw egg mixed with white rice, often seasoned with soy sauce)
Current Concerns: Being unable to hold the ball in one hand
Ability Parameters (out of 5): Power = 1; jump = 5; stamina = 5; intellect = 1; technique = 1; speed = 5

Hinata has an unusually high ability to jump. Since he was young, Hinata trained his legs to compensate for his lack of height. He joins Karusuno High School Volleyball team and amazes the team with his natural affinity as a spiker. Although he is a complete beginner and never had any experience playing in a volleyball team, he grows rapidly through each match.

Hinata has a cheerful and energetic personality. He's a natural schmoozer and his teammates would sometimes use him to win someone over, such as Nishinoya. Hinata gets excited easily and often talks loudly. He is the loudest member after Nishinoya and Tanaka. He is friendly and can befriend anyone easily, such as Kenma from Nekoma High and Aone from Date Tech High.

Despite his easy-going personality, Hinata is extremely competitive, especially when it comes to volleyball. As stated by Sugawara, Hinata has a very big fortitude to win and thus, doesn't give up easily during a match no matter if it's a practice match or a real match. Hinata can also exhibit a very scary and intimidating face when people underestimate him. Despite that, Hinata gets scared easily, especially by larger and stronger opponents. However, he recovers quickly and will then confidently challenge the opponents.

Favorite Food: Pork curry with a soft-boiled egg on top
Current Concerns: He's worried that animals seem to dislike him
Ability Parameters (out of 5): Power = 4; jump = 4; stamina = 5; intellect = 5; technique = 5; speed = 4

Kageyama was initially referred to as ""King of the Court,"" a derogatory nickname that insinuates his autocratic nature, given to him by his former teammates at Kitagawa Daiichi during his late middle school days. Kageyama is widely regarded as a stunning prodigy and an absolute genius by many of the prefecture's players and coaches. After joining Karasuno, he manages to change his attitude for the better with the help of his new teammates and rediscover what it means to be part of a team.

Unbeknownst to the majority of his schoolmates and acquaintances, however, he is actually much more sensitive and childish than he appears to be; he simply does not know how to control his frustration and express his thoughts and emotions in an appropriate way.

Since joining Karasuno, he has grown to be more respectful of his upperclassmen (Sugawara and Asahi in particular), as well as more accepting of people whose abilities and/or views differ from his own, and has come to once again understand the importance of teamwork and mutual trust in the sport he treasures so much. This has also helped him regain his confidence as a setter.

Year: 2nd year, Class 3
Number: 4
Position: Libero
Favorite food: Gari Gari-kun popsicles

Yuu is a very energetic and temperamental person. His boisterous nature and crazy shenanigans can attract unwanted attention quite easily, which often bodes ill for him. Although he hardly ever worries about the consequences of his actions (and may even revert to violence in order to vent out his anger on certain occasions), he is surprisingly considerate of his friends' feelings and insecurities.

Yuu can be extremely impatient, excitable and impulsive. As Ryuunosuke Tanaka puts it, ""he simply gets too fired up for his own good."" He doesn't bother to filter his words, and is therefore prone to blurting out whatever he's thinking in a loud and tactless manner. In-game, however, his attitude changes drastically: he becomes incredibly focused and serious, remaining calm and doing everything in his power to provide the support his team needs until the very end. For this reason, everyone in the volleyball club respects him greatly.

The captain and setter of the Aoba Jousai High School Volleyball Club. Oikawa was also Kageyama's senpai when they were attending Kitagawa Daiichi. According to Kageyama, he is a very talented setter and volleyball player with a bad personality.

Oikawa also frequently makes cheerful remarks, but follows them up with serious or intimidating afterthoughts. Despite his flirtatious and blasé exterior, Oikawa is extremely intelligent and cunning, to the point of his own teammates stating they wouldn't want to be friends with him because he figures out everyone's weakness.

He holds a grudge against Kageyama, whom he mockingly calls Tobio-chan. This is due to his feelings of inferiority when compared to Kageyama, who has been hailed as a genius setter since their time spent at Kitagawa Daiichi. Kageyama can unintentionally bring out the more childish or rash aspects of Oikawa's personality.

A member of the Karasuno High volleyball club, Tsukishima is very blunt and has a habit of riling people up (usually Hinata, Kageyama, and even his senpais Tanaka and Nishinoya). He dislikes “hot-blooded people” and doesn’t like to exert too much effort due to the past experiences of his older brother. Aside from others like Daichi, Sugawara, and Asahi, he has little to no respect for his other teammates and is shown to be quite irritated at having to be close to them (seen as Karasuno huddled up to build up their spirits and again when he expressed disgust in having to stay with the team during training camp). He can even be rude to Yamaguchi (the person closest to him) which really shows his spiteful personality. The second years think of him as someone with a warped personality. He also teases Kageyama both by calling him ""the king"" as well as referring to the rest of the players as common folk, which angers him to the core.

Kenma has a very relaxed and laid back personality. He hardly ever loses his cool, and he usually never gets excited about anything (with the exception of Hinata and video games). He is quiet and reserved and does not voice his opinions often since he is afraid of how others would think of them. He isn't the type who can make friends easily, and his only friend back when he was younger had been Tetsurou Kuroo. Despite his modest personality, Kenma is actually quite skilled in volleyball, with his extraordinary game sense and technique, which makes up for his power, speed, and stamina.

Being the vice captain, he has a soothing personality for his teammates and acts as a pillar of support for them. Even though he isn't Karasuno's official setter anymore, he doesn't dream of giving up on playing in general. As such, he encourages himself and all of his teammates not to give up, no matter how rough the situation might be.

Sugawara's dedication to volleyball is clear when he decides to continue club activities even when most third years choose to retire to focus on their futures. In a meeting, his teacher asked Sugawara why he's so determined to continue playing even though he's not a starting member, and Sugawara replied that he doesn't want to have regrets in the future.

He is also quite perceptive as he noticed how Tanaka asked for the key to the gym (back during the first years's 3-on-3 match) even though he always comes in late, so Sugawara knew that something was up. He is also intelligent as he can come up with helpful tactics during the game. An example of this is when he came up with the idea of saying ""bring it"" and ""send it to me"" for Kageyama and Hinata's combo.

Bokuto Koutaro is a 3rd year Captain and Wing Spiker of Fukurodani Volleyball Team. Together with Kuroo, he teaches Tsukishima Kei Volleyball despite the fact that Karasuno High is a formidable opponent.

He has a playful, energetic and child-like personality and is described by his team as having mood swings, where even the slightest thing can change his mood which then impacts his performance. He is often referred to as 'simple-minded' because of this, but is both admired by his own team and the opponents for his impressive skills and morale-boosting demeanor.

When he makes a comeback, he clearly shows his pride as the ace and believes he is the 'strongest'. Bokuto is energetic (similar to Hinata), often making jokes about everything and acting rather dramatically about his plays. His personality is so compatible that he gets along with many people. However, he's rather ignorant to other people's discomfort, such as with Tsukishima.

Oshino, Shinobu;Shinobu Oshino (忍野 忍);"Shinobu ""Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade, Fair Princess"" Oshino";"

She appears to be an eight-year-old girl, but she was originally a beautiful vampire who had lived for more than 500 years. At the end of events of Koyomi Vamp, after Koyomi realizes that having saved his master from a certain death, leaded to a future where she will kill humans (the ""portable food"" she calls them) to ensure her survival, Koyomi revolts against Kissshot in a bloody battle to death, where Kissshot chooses not to use her full powers (in order to have a proper battle with her servant). Later on the battle it is revealed that she pretended to turn Koyomi into a human again, by letting herself be killed by Koyomi. After the shocking revelation, he cannot bring himself to kill his master who was giving her life for his, and who cared for him at the point of risking her life to save his (from sunburn) at the beginning of Spring's Break. But to prevent herself from eating more humans, Koyomi asked for help to Oshino Meme, who in the end tells that as a happy ending won't be possible for everyone, then everyone will have an unhappy ending! While Koyomi himself cannot return to be a fully human, Kissshot Acerolaorion Heartunderblade was left in a weakened condition (where she is no longer able to eat humans, and needs her servant's blood to survive) with no powers or traces of her original personality and therefore have to abandon her ""Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade"" (キスショット・アセロラオリオン・ハートアンダーブレード) name. Ever since ""Tsubasa Cat"" where she starts living in Araragi's shadow, she no longer needs to suck his blood on a regular basis in order to stay alive. She forms a physical connection with Araragi where they can feel each others emotions and senses. It is also later revealed that she can gain strength into an ""evolved"" form after sucking Araragi's blood more than the usual dosage, she does this in order to fight for Araragi when he confronts Yotsugi and Yozuru. In Mayoi Jiangshi, in the alternate timeline, Shinobu went berserk when Koyomi was killed by Black Hanekawa, feeling that she was somewhat responsible for his death, so she swore to destroy the world and created the Jiangshi that has been swarming the town. It seems that she truly cares about Koyomi and when she saw Koyomi was alive in the alternate timeline, she started weeping blood. In the end, Araragi simply states that he will die together with Shinobu. Her father named her Lola, however she went by the name Acerola.

Koyomi Araragi is a third year high school student who survived a vampire attack during spring break and barely regained his human life in the time that followed as a boy with remnants of vampiric traits. He can see in the dark, his eyes turn red when he gets angry, and he heals incredibly fast. As a result, he questions his lifespan. He remains scared of morning sunlight despite the fact that it no longer has any negative effects on him.

Koyomi is a laid-back person whose only real friend at school is Tsubasa Hanekawa. He's a poor student, close to failing every class except math.

It is revealed through conversations that he's quite knowledgeable with anime; a fact even noted by Nadeko Sengoku once.

Although he is shown to be attracted to the other girls, he turns their advances down due to his loyalty to Hitagi.

Other characters seems to speculate that Koyomi is a lolicon, particularly Mayoi and Hitagi, with Hitagi thinking that Nadeko is a ""threat"" to her.

He is very noble, which is why Hitagi is attracted to him. He is willing to help others at the cost of his own life. As such, the female characters he has helped are quite attached to him. He feels most comfortable talking to Mayoi, Shinobu and, from the Second Season on, to Yotsugi about his problems.

Koyomi is the only person who thinks that his family relationship is bad, with Karen and Tsukihi thinking otherwise. His parents were revealed to be police officers.

His personality is portrayed more clearly in the novels, where his inner thoughts show him to be much more perverted and intelligent than the anime leads one to believe.

Due to events prior to
Kizumonogatari
and
Bakemonogatari
, Koyomi avoided having friends and seemed to have lost faith and trust in people and himself.

She is always seen dressed in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, even outside of school days, and is rarely seen on any other type of clothing, except for a set of sleepwear which she wore during Tsubasa Cat Arc.

Hanekawa Tsubasa is Araragi's classmate and the class president. Araragi describes her as ""the class president of all class presidents."" The reason Tsubasa and Hitagi cut their hair short is because they learned Araragi likes it short.

Hanekawa currently lives with her stepfather and stepmother.


Hanekawa Family's Past:

Her biological mother was 17 years old when she got pregnant, the biological father is unknown because she apparently had many lovers. Before she gave birth to Tsubasa, she married another man who was a ""workaholic."" Right after giving birth, Tsubasa's biological mother commited suicide. The workaholic stepfather, unable to raise a child, remarried again to a woman who is Tsubasa's current mother. The workaholic father soon died from overwork and the current mother married another man who is now Tsubasa's current father.

Hanekawa Story's overview in Nekomonogatari/Bakemonogatari:

Prior to the beginning of Bakemonogatari Hanekawa was possessed by a bakeneko (mischievous spirit of a dead cat) during Golden Week due to stress over her family (see Nekomonogatari: Kuro). The matter was eventually resolved with the help of Shinobu at the cost of some of Hanekawa's memories, but the problem emerged again right before the school festival because of different stress. Araragi was told by Hanekawa's bakeneko form that she has feelings for him. In ""Tsubasa Tiger"" (Nekomonogatari: Shiro), on her way to school, she met a tiger spirit which spoke to her. Soon buildings important to Hanekawa began to mysteriously burn down and ""Black Hanekawa"" (her bakeneko form) began to take over her body every time she slept. The inevitable showdown was afoot and led to some surprising events. ""Tsubasa Tiger"" is written from the perspective of Hanekawa rather than Araragi."

Meme is a middle-aged man who lives in an abandoned building. Being an expert in apparitions field, he solves Koyomi and others' problems. Although he sometimes expects compensation, he does not require it always and seems to help those in need from good nature. Due to his vast knowledge of supernatural studies and general oddities, he serves as Araragi's informant during his stay in the city.

Oshino is a graduate of Shinto studies in college, although he never pursued the career of being a Shinto priest. Despite that, he is perfectly capable to accomplish spiritual works of a Shinto priest, such as exorcising entities and solving paranormal mysteries. He occasionally wears a Priest's outfit, as seen with the session with Senjougahara and the heavy crab. Meme's other notable accessories include an earring on his right ear and a necklace, both consisting of an inverted cross."

Guillotinecutter is the archbishop of a new religion he created which purports that he is god. He is one of the three vampire hunters with Episode and Dramaturgie, who
stole both of Shinobu's (Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade's) arms. Unlike the other two, he is completely human. Oshino comments that while Guillotinecutter stole two of Kiss-Shot's limbs instead of one each like the other two hunters, it does not mean he was the strongest among them. This is reflected in how he resorted to kidnap Hanekawa before his fight with Araragi.


After he was defeated, he attempts to slay fully-recovered Kiss-Shot but then he gets killed and consumed by Kiss-Shot herself."

Miyazono, Kaori;Kaori Miyazono (宮園 かをり);"Kaori ""Kao-chan"" Miyazono";"
Age: 14-15
Birthday: July 4

Kaori Miyazono is one of the main protagonists of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. She is a violinist who helps Kousei Arima return to the piano world after his mother's death.

Kaori Miyazono is a free-spirited violinist whose playing style reflects on her personality. She is independent, unpredictable, and short-tempered. It is also touched upon that she is passive aggressive at times. Kaori likes to depend on herself and only herself and can be seen as more of a support for others.

While considered a really sloppy violin player from a technical standpoint, such as not following music score sheets the way they are written, Kaori is an amazing violinist. Noted by one of the judges at Towa Hall during the first competition of the series, her pure abilities far exceed the others in the competition. She wields a free spirited style of performance that emphasizes emotions and artistry over the pure mechanics of music, such playing to specific tempos and dynamics originally intended by the composer. Her style of music is what rekindles Kousei's passion for the piano and inspires him to redefine himself as a musician.

In addition, she has the ability to play the melodica and has had some experience playing the piano.


When Kaori was five-years-old, her piano class went to see a music recital, there, she first saw Kousei. From the moment he touched the keys and started playing, she was immediately inspired by the spirit in his music. Kaori was originally an aspiring pianist herself, however later decided that she would become a violinist and have Kousei play with her. Kaori was always a physically weak child, and underwent many surgeries. Over time, her hospitalisations became more frequent and prolonged. One day, she saw her parents crying in the hospital as they realized she didn't have a lot of time left. Because of this, she decided to live a full and happy life before passing away. She put on the contacts which she never had the courage to wear, ate a lot and ignored the aspect of her appearance and played the music the way she wanted to and not how everyone else wanted her to. Then, she told a lie.

It is later revealed that she wasn't able to perform with Kousei after she fell and hit her head at home, resulting in her bleeding and passing out. After this incident, Kousei rushed to visit Kaori after hearing from Tsubaki that she was hospitalised again. It later comes to a point where it becomes obvious her health is deteriorating rapidly and she can no longer hide her illness from her friends. She is shown at one stage that her illness has caused bouts of paralysis in her legs, where she suddenly falls to the ground while walking down the hallway in the hospital, unable to make herself stand up. As Kaori's final days were coming, she wrote a farewell letter to Kousei. On February 18, the day of Kousei's piano competition, Kaori had her operation. At her funeral, her mother gave the letter she wrote to Kousei.

After witnessing Kousei performing at the recital, she was awestruck by him and immediately gave up on playing the piano as she wants Kousei to play for her. A few years later, Kaori finally got to meet with Kousei. After getting to know each other, they both realised that they as musicians, have a lot in common. Kaori first found out that Kousei became tone-deaf when he's concentrating on playing the piano when she asked him to play 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' in a cafe. She then demanded Kousei to be her accompanist. Although reluctant at first, Kousei finally accepted when Kaori begged him to support her in that ""moment that she's about to lose heart."" Their relationship gradually strengthens and they start spending more and more time together, especially in the music room. Kousei found himself falling in love with Kaori, but held back because she was Watari's love interest. At the end of the series after Kaori's death, it is revealed that she always had a crush on Kousei and always loved him since she was young, and because she knew Tsubaki also loved Kousei and would never introduce her to him if she found out, thus having to lie about her faked crush on Watari just so she could approach Kousei.

Arima, Kousei;Kousei Arima (有馬 公生);"Kousei ""Friend A, Human Metronome"" Arima";"
Age: 14-15
Birthday: March 28

Kousei is a prodigy pianist and was the youngest pianist to win the Saki Competition but quit playing after the death of his mother resulted in his inability to hear the sounds of his own playing. Following the death of his mother, he lived two years without playing the piano and saw the world through monotone colors, but this changed after meeting Kaori Miyazono, a beautiful young musician who pushed Kousei to his limits in an attempt to get his fingers back onto the piano keys.


As a child, Kousei was obedient and calm. Due to his fear of his mother, Tsubaki was the only one to convince him to tag along in her adventures. Despite being afraid of her, Kousei loved his mother and played freely for her during a competition which angered her. Until later in the story, there are still traces of his mother's verbal and physical abuse that linger in his psyche. Whenever he thought about his piano days, a darkened image of his sick mother would often appear similar to that of a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) attack. His last performance following the death of his mother traumatized him to the extent of leaving him unable to hear himself play. Despite being unable to play piano, music was omnipresent in his life as he would spend his lunch breaks composing. Despite having friends like Watari and Tsubaki, Kousei spends most of his day alone in his thoughts. This dense characteristic makes him a little oblivious to what is going on around him. For instance, he does not notice the resentment his fellow piano competitors had for him nor Tsubaki's crush on him. He also stares at Kaori for long, awkward periods thinking how great of a person she is which she misinterprets as him having perverted thoughts of her. Kousei admires Kaori because she is his opposite; he wishes to become more free-spirited like her. The closer Kousei and Kaori get, the more his feelings for her deepen and the more he opens up to other people. She helps him build his confidence and convinces him to perform again.

Kousei became a piano player at the request of his mother's friend, Hiroko Seto, after Kousei perfectly recreated an improvised song that Hiroko was playing in frustration towards her husband. This led to his mother becoming his piano mentor and teaching him how to play. Following a collapse in his mother's health, Kousei's style of learning to play the piano was drastically changed, as his mother began beating him until he could perfectly play a song based on how it was written in the score. As a result, Kousei started becoming distant from his friends and focused solely on perfecting his piano skills in an attempt to satisfy his mother and make her happy. Kousei was then entered into a number of competitions, in which he stunned the audience with his perfect playing and attained the title ""The Human Metronome"" and was often referred to as his mother's puppet due to Kousei's lack of free will and emotion. Following a winning performance at the Saiki Competition, Saki attacked Kousei and drew blood, causing an outrage amongst competition attendees, but mostly between Saki, Kousei, and Hiroko, with Kousei lashing out at his mother and stating how he wishes that she ""would just die. Coincidentally, Saki passes away a few days later, with the two not having spoken at all between these events. Kousei, feeling guilty about his last words towards his mother and also missing her tremendously, gradually becomes tone deaf during a competition a few days later, breaking down and later hiding in a corner of a room in the concert hall to cry, with only the comfort given from Hiroko. He later gives up being a pianist due to his tone deafness.

Birthday: May 19

Tsubaki is Kousei's childhood friend. She has always gone to his performances and cheered him on. Tsubaki would often invite Kousei to play outside but due to his practice time with his mother, she usually ended in failure. Being with Kousei for a long time, Tsubaki gradually took on the role as an ""older sister."" Kousei was that ""useless little brother she just had to take care of."" Rather than the music type, Tsubaki was the athletic type. She was on the softball team in both middle school and high school along with her senpai from middle school where she enjoyed the sport a lot.

Ryouta is Kousei and Tsubaki's childhood friend who is also the captain of the school's soccer team. He is extremely popular with girls, often adopting a frivolous attitude. However, he does once in a while come up with good insight.

Ryota is a bit of a play-boy. He seems to prefer girls who are ""cute"" seen as he comments in episode 1 that when he sees Kaori for the first time he stated that Tsubaki did a good job on finding a cute looking girl.

Igawa, Emi;Emi Igawa (井川 絵見);Emi  Igawa;"
One of the best middle school pianist in the story, on par with Takeshi. She is known to play to her emotions and can be thrown off of her game with the slightest sense of discomfort.

It was shown that prior to the storyline, Emi and Takeshi are sitting together complaining about the ""emotionless"" Kousei Arima after losing to him in a piano competition. The rest of the crowd points out that Takeshi and Emi are head and shoulders above the rest of the competition, which makes Kousei all the more invincible for beating the two. While Takeshi sees Kousei as a rival that pushes him to greater heights, Emi has a different motive. She was originally inspired by Kousei's passion and pure innocence during his first performance, she decided to learn piano under Yuriko Ochiai for the sake of expression. Over the course of the story, Emi seeks to oppose the ""boring"" playing style of the old Kousei in hopes to find the ""true"" Kousei once again.

Seto, Koharu;Koharu Seto (瀬戸 小春);Koharu  Seto;"
Daughter of Hiroko Seto, Koharu is generally a happy and cheerful child who adores her mother. Koharu has been shown to be quite shy and hesitant around others when she first meets them, but eventually warms up to them and begins to consider them as her family, as seen when she drew a picture of Nagi Aiza playing the piano with Kousei Arima.

(Source: Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso Wiki)"
Aiza, Nagi;Nagi Aiza (相座 凪 / 藍里 凪);"Nagi ""Nagi Aizato"" Aiza";"
Nagi is Kousei Arima's first apprentice and student. She is a first year student, studying a music course in Kurumigaoka Junior High School. She initially introduced herself as Hiroko Seto's fan, but her ulterior motives were revealed later on.

Nagi is stubborn and childish. She was introduced as a cunning character who despises Arima Kousei.

Nagi maintains a realistic look in life and repeatedly testifies her hate for cliché. Because of her unerring piano skills, she is slightly arrogant and claims herself as ""Angel of Kurumi Junior High"". Nagi also appears to have a distaste for anyone who refers to their superiors without the appropriate honorific, as shown when Miike did not refer to Kousei Arima as his Sensei or Senpai, instead addressing him directly as ""Arima.""

Nagi is often seen to have a brother-complex, seeming to be completely fixated on her brother Takeshi. This complex has driven her to follow in his footsteps in order to get him to notice her and to also stop her brother's own fixation on Kousei.


In the later parts of the anime, Nagi warms up to Kousei, comforting and trying to make him smile while he was upset. Nagi holds deep respect for Kousei and admires him for his piano playing skills. Though it is not stated if she holds affection for him.

Nagi already has exceptional skills in piano before she became Kousei's apprentice. She is the prize winner of the Elena International Music Contest and Obtained the grand prize at the Matsuno Music Contest. When Seto-san asked her to demonstrate her skill, she easily performed Etude Op. 25 No. 5, the same piece Kousei played at the Maihou Competition. During her lessons with Kousei, she blames her small hands for not being able to play in the right tempo or dynamic. Her skills improves drastically after being tutored by Kousei and can even keep up with his playing during her school festival performance. Unlike most musicians in the story, Nagi doesn't perform for 'glory or perfection' but for obligation to become closer to her brother.


When she was younger, she saw her elder brother as some sort of hero. They often played together and had a close relationship, but Takeshi started to fix on Kousei Arima. Because of that, he started to practice hard and the strong bond between the two became thinner over the years. In order to be closer to her brother, Nagi starts to play the piano herself and enters a music Middle School

Aiza, Takeshi;Takeshi Aiza (相座 武士);Takeshi  Aiza;"
Takeshi has a very honest and straightforward personality. He is very upfront about his rivalry and hatred (at first) for Kousei Arima. This hatred is later revealed to be an admiration of Takeshi, and how he looked up to Kousei as a hero. Takeshi looks up to Kousei to the extent of rebuking Kousei when he did not meet his expectations as a pianist.

Takeshi is one of the best piano players of his generation, as mentioned for being invited to Europe for competitions and winning the majority of recent piano competitions in Japan.

It was shown that prior to the storyline, Takeshi and Emi Igawa are sitting together complaining about the ""emotionless"" Kousei after losing to him in a piano competition. The rest of the crowd points out that Takeshi and Emi are head and shoulders above the rest of the competition, which makes Kousei all the more invincible for beating the two. In the storyline, it is shown that Takeshi looked up to Kousei as a hero, and constantly practiced in order to surpass Kousei.

A legendary rakugo performer who is haunted by his past. He refused to take in any apprentices until he met Yotarou.

As a child, Bon had originally trained as a dancer until damage to his leg left him unable to dance. Bon's mother, a geisha, sent him to train as a rakugo performer under the Seventh Generation Yakumo Yuurakutei alongside Shin, a boy who shows up unexpectedly and is accepted on a whim. While he proved to be adept at the basics of rakugo, and possessed impressive potential to memorize stories, his performances were stiff and lacked emotion and passion. Shin, with his impressive love for rakugo, quickly overtook him. As an apprentice, he was given the name ""Kikuhiko."" In an attempt to find his own style, Kikuhiko began performing 'bawdy and erotic' stories and discovered his strong ability to personify feminine characters.


Kikuhiko pursued a romantic relationship with a geisha named Miyokichi, but broke things off in order to more seriously pursue rakugo as a career, leaving her angry and heartbroken. Desperate to have her revenge, she fell pregnant with Sukeroku's child, and the two eloped. After the Seventh Generation Yakumo died, and the crushing loneliness became too much to bear, Kikuhiko sought out Sukeroku at the countryside town where he had taken up residence. After bearing witness to the tragic deaths of Sukeroku and Miyokichi, for which he blamed himself, Kikuhiko took it upon himself to raise their daughter, Konatsu, Shortly after, he took up the title of the Eighth Generation Yakumo Yuurakutei.

After ten years of training under Yakumo, he is promoted the rank of shin'uchi. To celebrate, he shaves his head and takes on the title of the Third Generation Sukeroku Yuurakutei.

He gets married to Konatsu a few years after Shinnosuke is born. Together they have a daughter, Koyuki. Sixteen years after his master's death, he becomes the Ninth Generation Yakumo Yuurakutei."

Shin was the Eighth Generation Yakumo's lifelong friend and partner growing up, and Konatsu's father. Apprenticed under Yakumo Yuurakutei alongside Bon, he was originally given the name ""Hatsutarou,"" but rejected it to instead perform under the name ""Sukeroku."" As a shin'uchi, his unique and passionate style of performing quickly earns him a name and reputation in the rakugo community, but also strikes a nerve with the traditionalist members of the rakugo association.

Sukeroku and Kikuhiko made a promise with each other to ensure rakugo's survival as an art form together—Sukeroku would practice rakugo that changed to appeal to the public and Kikuhiko would practice rakugo that never changed and stayed true to its roots. This promise would go unfulfilled when Sukeroku died a tragic death at a young age, but his impact on rakugo as an art never faded.


As a penniless abandoned child, Shin found himself drawn to a rakugo street performer named Sukeroku, who trained him—making Shin the Second Generation Sukeroku. In his prime, the First Generation Sukeroku was apprenticed alongside the Seventh Generation Yakumo, who sabotaged him and caused his downfall. When Sukeroku was forced to leave the Yuurakutei household due to both his callous disregard for higher-ranked rakugo performers and Yakumo's own insecurities, he eloped with Miyokichi, with whom he fathered Konatsu. Sukeroku and Miyokichi both died in the titular lovers' suicide."

Sukeroku and Miyokichi, her mother, moved to the countryside to give birth to her. Miyokichi skipped town in the aftermath, leaving Sukeroku to raise her alone. In this time, she grew to adore her father's rakugo, and learn how to perform in his style to entertain customers at a local soba shop. Following her parents' tragic deaths, she was taken in by Kikuhiko, who actively discouraged her from performing rakugo whenever he could, though she continued to practice in secret. Ten years after meeting Yotarou, she falls pregnant.


A few years after she gives birth to her son, Shinnosuke, she falls in love with and marries Yotarou. When Shinnosuke is 7, she falls pregnant again with a daughter she names Koyuki. Before Koyuki is born, Konatsu successfully convinces Yakumo to become his second apprentice, but he dies moments later. Sixteen years after his death, she is able to become a rakugo performer under the name ""Kousukeroku."" She refuses to talk about the identity of Shinnosuke's biological father, and while Yotarou believes it is his former yakuza boss, Higuchi theorizes much later that it may be the Eighth Generation Yakumo himself. She does not confirm or deny this idea."

Eventually Kikuhiko rejected her and out of spite she began a relationship with Sukeroku which resulted in her becoming pregnant with their daughter, Konatsu. Sukeroku and Miyokichi eventually left for the countryside after Sukeroku's expulsion. However, she did not care for Sukeroku or Konatsu and instead turned to prostitution to earn money. After Kikuhiko appeared and rejected her advances again, she attempted suicide, but Sukeroku convinced her to stop. However, she slipped from a balcony and in his attempt to save her, both Miyokichi and Sukeroku fell to their deaths.

Ginko employs himself as a Mushi master (mushishi), traveling from place to place to research Mushi and aid people suffering from problems caused by them.

Ginko is a rare person who attracts mushi. This inspires his peripatetic lifestyle; staying in one place too long will gather a potentially dangerous amount of mushi. He also smokes constantly in order to keep mushi away.

In terms of personality, Ginko is rather laid back, but can be very serious when it comes to protecting people from mushi. He also often stresses that the mushi are not evil, but they merely exist as a part of the nature and try to survive like every other living being.


When Nui found him, he was unconscious in the woods, wounded and abandoned. As he had no place to go, Nui decided to care for him instead of making him leave. He went by the name ""Yoki"" until Nui was consumed by the Ginko mushi. Yoki lost his memory and was forced to take a new name because of the nature of the Ginko mushi, thus changing his name in the only thing he remembers, ""Ginko""

Ginko's unusual white hair and green eye color is the result of an incident involving a mushi that occurred when he was a child.

He lost his other eye and hair color when he tried to save Nui from the Ginko mushi that lived in the pond near where they lived. Nui protected Ginko by telling him to offer them as a sacrifice so the Ginko would let him be. He never saw Nui again and after nearly being consumed by the mushi he adopted the name Ginko to save himself."

Birthdate: June 26, 2044
Height: 185 cm (6' 1"")
Weight: 70 kg (155 lbs)
Blood type: O
Planet of Origin: Mars

Spike Spiegel is a tall and lean 27-year-old bounty hunter born on Mars. The inspiration for Spike is found in martial artist Bruce Lee who uses the martial arts style of Jeet Kune Do as depicted in Session 8, ""Waltz For Venus"". He has fluffy, dark green hair (which is inspired by Yusaku Matsuda's) and reddish brown eyes, one of which is artificial and lighter than the other. He is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and Lupin III inspired boots. A flashback in Session 6 revealed it was his fully functioning right eye which was surgically replaced by the cybernetic one (although Spike himself may not have conscious recollection of the procedure since he claims to have lost his natural eye in an ""accident""). One theory is that his natural eye may have been lost during the pre-series massacre in which he supposedly ""died"". The purpose of this cybernetic eye is never explicitly stated, though it apparently gives him exceptional hand-eye coordination - particularly with firearms (Spike's gun of choice is a Jericho 941, as seen throughout the series). In the first episode, when facing a bounty-head using Red Eye, Spike mocks him, calling his moves ""too slow"". At first, this seems like posturing on Spike's part, but even with his senses and reflexes accelerated to superhuman levels by the drug, the bounty cannot even touch Spike. A recurring device throughout the entire show is a closeup on Spike's fully-natural left eye before dissolving to a flashback of his life as part of the syndicate. As said by Spike himself in the last episode, his right eye ""only sees the present"" and his left eye ""only sees the past."" Spike often has a bent cigarette between his lips, sometimes despite rain or ""No Smoking"" signs."
Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV, Edward;Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV (エドワード・ウォン・ハウ・ペペル・チブルスキー4世);"Edward ""Ed, Radical Ed, Françoise"" Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV";"
The self-invented personal name of an elite net-diver from Earth, hacker ""Radical Edward"" is a very strange, somewhat androgynous, teenage girl assumed to be around 13 years in age. She has a feral aspect reflected in her mannerisms, bare feet, strange postures and gangling walk.

Ed could be considered a ""free spirit""; she is fond of silly exclamations and childish rhymes, easily distracted, and the show's primary source of physical humor.

Over the course of the show she rarely walks anywhere, preferring to run, crawl, flip, roll, walk on her hands, or even just saunter. Ed is always barefoot. In one episode, she considers putting on socks and shoes, but quickly removes them, as even wearing socks hampers her, and she falls over seconds after putting them on; she also appears to be exceptionally strong and flexible, being able to support her weight on her arms for several minutes at a time, and to scratch her nose with her toe.

In the English version, she almost always refers to herself in the third person.

Not much is known about her origins, only that she spent some of her earlier childhood in an orphanage after being left there by her father, a man named Afedersiniz Hesap Lütfen (he calls Ed ""Françoise"", and may be of Turkish origin as his name means ""excuse me, check please"" in Turkish). In the manga it is revealed that she was a friend of a timid young boy in the orphanage known simply as ""Tomato"" (which also happens to be the brand name scrawled in katakana on her PC) who, like Ed, knew a great deal about computers and the net, and it is probably safe to assume that his friendship with Ed helped turn her into the genius-hacker she is today.

Ed's primary use to the Bebop crew is as a hacker; she is widely known to be a whiz kid behind a computer. Ed's computer of choice is a carry-along Tomato desktop, an homage to the portable flatpanel-outfitted Apple IIc from the 80s, and when traveling by foot she will balance it on her head.

Ed has a strong rapport with Jet, who acts as a surrogate father, and Faye, who acts as something of a big sister (much to Faye's chagrin). Ed also seems to be the only person who can understand Ein (though in a few instances Jet could understand Ein also)."
Valentine, Faye;Faye Valentine (フェイ・バレンタイン);Faye  Valentine;"
Faye Valentine
Birthday: August 14, 1994

One of the members of the bounty hunting crew in the anime series Cowboy Bebop. Often seen with a cigarette and in a revealing outfit complete with bright yellow hot pants and a matching, revealing top, black suspenders, white boots, and a long-sleeved red shirt worn normally through the sleeves, not to mention her signature headband, she is unusually attractive, sporting a bob of violet hair, green eyes, fair skin, and a voluptuous body. Although appearing to be no more than her 23 years alive suggests, Faye is actually upwards of 74-years-old, having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident. During the course of the series (set in 2071), Faye manages to cross paths with Spike and Jet twice before she finally makes herself at home aboard their ship the second time, much to the consternation and disapproval of the two men, both of whom have their own reservations about women in general. Faye herself is brash, egotistical, and quite lazy, despite taking plenty of time to pamper and care for her own appearance. Faye has also been placed under arrest several times in the series and spends much time in handcuffs on the ship. She, at times, expects the boys to take care of bounties for her, while she sits by idly to reap the benefits and eat all their food, another source of conflict.

Seemingly little more than a thorn in her partners’ sides, Faye is actually a well-rounded member of the team. She can handle herself exceptionally well for a woman of her slight appearance, displaying at least once in the series (in ""Cowboy Funk"") that she packs quite a mean punch. Adept at flying, Faye has stood her ground just as well as Spike has in an aerial dogfight in her ship Red Tail, at times even against Spike in an aerial dogfight. She also excels with guns, and is first seen in the series completely disabling a ship with a Heckler & Koch MP5, though she is immediately apprehended afterward. In the movie, she is seen with the same gun, in addition to her normal companion: a Glock 30. Where Faye really shines, however, is with her mouth. She has an almost unstoppable attitude, and even her sometimes innocent smile can be seen as dangerous. Sarcastic and presumptuous, she rarely appears weak or in need of support. She brags and takes care of herself, never trusting others, cheating and lying her way from one day to the next.


She is a woman who is skilled at getting what she wants; however, her indomitable exterior hides a more delicate interior. Upon awakening from her 54-year cryogenic sleep, not only was she saddled with a massive amount of debt that she had no means to pay, but she was also diagnosed with total amnesia, a stranger in a mysterious world that she was not a part of and did not understand, surrounded by people who claimed to be helping her but were only there to take advantage of her naiveté. The surname ""Valentine"" was merely a name given to her by the doctor who woke her; the circumstances of her accident, her previous life, and even her real name all remain a mystery, and are only gradually revealed as the series progresses. It has been hinted that she came from Singapore on Earth, and was the daughter of a very wealthy family, as the city's famous Merlion Statue features prominently in scenes of her childhood, and that memories and a film from her childhood showed her living in a large mansion. In an early episode, she states that she is descended from Roma people, but she may well have been lying. Utterly betrayed by someone she thought she could trust after waking, Faye found herself burdened with even more money to pay, and the situation resulted in the hardening of her personality to an extreme degree. She even says in Session 11: “we deceive or we are deceived”, and that “nothing good ever happened to me when I trusted others.”
Throughout the series, though she retains her sarcastic demeanor and unpleasant nature up until the very end, it is easy to see her grow as a character. She learns to value her comrades, coming back to the Bebop when she realizes that it is the only home that she has left, naming it as the “only place I could return to”. She grows to understand the disadvantages of being a loner, and that even though her ""family"" is somewhat dysfunctional it is still a place where she will always belong.

Black, Jet;Jet Black (ジェット・ブラック);"Jet ""Running Rock, Black Dog"" Black";"
Jet, known on his home satellite as the ""Black Dog"" for his tenacity, is a 36-year-old former cop from Ganymede (a Jovian satellite) and acts as Spike's foil during the series. Physically, Jet is very tall with a muscular build. He wears a beard with no mustache, and is completely bald save for the back of his head. Spike acts lazy and uninterested, whereas Jet is hard working and a jack-of-all-trades. Jet was once an investigator in the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) for many years until he lost his arm in an investigation that went awry when his corrupt partner (and friend at the time) betrayed him. His arm was replaced with a cybernetic limb (later revealed to be by choice, as biological replacements were possible, he wanted the fake arm as a reminder of what happened), yet his loss of limb coupled with the general corruption of the police force prompted Jet to quit the ISSP in disgust and become a freelance bounty hunter. Jet also considers himself something of a renaissance man: he cultivates bonsai trees, cooks, enjoys jazz/blues music (he named his ship the Bebop, referring to a type of jazz), especially Charlie Parker, and even has interest in Goethe. As a character, Jet is the quintessential oyaji or ""dad"" even though he often wishes people would view him as a more brotherly figure (so as not to seem old).

Jet is skilled with handguns, typically carrying a pre-2004 Walther P99, as well as the use of the netgun. He is good with hand to hand combat as well. Unlike Spike, Jet tends to use more raw muscle than technique. He is also a great mechanic and pilot. Aside from the converted interplanetary fishing trawler vessel Bebop, Jet flies a smaller ship called Hammerhead. The Hammerhead appears to be a modified (Jet added larger engines and fuel tanks) salvage-craft that uses a mechanical arm equipped with a harpoon as its main weapon, which is somewhat analogous to his own mechanical arm. Both the Hammerhead and the Bebop are able to land on water, and have a fishing theme, most likely because Ganymede's surface is mostly covered with water (it is later revealed that the Bebop was originally a fishing ship that Jet ""customized"" with larger engines).

During the series, it is revealed that Jet once lived with a woman named Alisa, who left him because he was too controlling. Later they meet up again when Alisa's new boyfriend Rhint is wanted for murder. Jet then ends up in a situation somewhat similar to that of Vicious, where he must hunt down a woman who broke his heart, and her lover.


In a later episode, another Vicious/Spike parallel is set up when Jet finds out that it was his old partner Fad who betrayed him (though in Jet's case, there was no love affair involved). Fad arranged for Jet's death in a setup, but he survived with only a missing arm and a scar on his face. It is worth noting that Jet managed to face the demons of his past and let them go, in contrast to Spike, who was killed when he confronted his. This is likely due to the contrast in the two approaches to the past. While Spike hid and fled from his past, Jet tracked it down and confronted it."
Ein;Ein  (アイン);Ein  ;"
Ein is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi brought aboard the Bebop by Spike after a failed attempt to capture a bounty. Ein is a ""data dog"": while the televised series only briefly hints on the fact that this means Ein's brain was somehow enhanced drastically, the manga shows Ed accessing data stored in Ein's brain via a virtual reality-type interface with which she has a conversation with a human proprietor. It is obvious that Ein is abnormally intelligent, as he is able to answer the telephone, drive a car (just the wheel), use the SSW, play shōgi, and generally do a number of other things that an average canine should not be able to do, but he never talks in a human language during the show. He does, however, speak in Session 18 ""Speak Like A Child"" after the credits Ein tells Spike ""Next Episode: Wild Horses"". He is able to ""speak"" to other species, as demonstrated in Session 17, ""Mushroom Samba"" (he spoke to a cow with a subtitled bark of ""Thanks"", to which the cow has a subtitled moo back of ""No problem""). It is likely that Ed is the only crew member with any idea of Ein's capabilities, as the other crew members are quick to dismiss Ein, and never seem to acknowledge him as more than a pet. Ein initially takes a shine to Jet, but when Ed joins the crew, he comes around to her as well. Frequently the two trade roles, with Ein expressing very human sentiments via facial expression and Ed regressing to a feral state. He went with Ed after she left the crew, probably because of his attachment to her. His name is a pun on the Japanese word for ""dog"" (犬 inu) but is also German for ""one"". ""Ein"" may also be short for ""Einstein"", after Albert Einstein, because of the extraordinary intelligence he possesses."
Vicious;Vicious  (ビシャス);Vicious  ;"
It's all in the name with Vicious: he is ruthless, bloodthirsty, cunning and ambitious, willing to do anything in order to secure a position of power. He is a member of the Red Dragon Crime Syndicate in Tharsis, and is often referred to or depicted as a venomous snake. His weapon of choice is not a firearm, but a katana which he wields skillfully, even against gun-wielders. After Spike's supposed death, Vicious also leaves the Red Dragons briefly to fight in the Titan War of 2068 although his precise motivations for enlisting are debated.

After the war, Gren came back hoping to be a jazz musician, but that plan was cut short when he was arrested on the pretense of being a spy. In prison, Gren heard that Vicious testified against him; this and the isolation drove him mad. The prison used prisoners for drug experiments, and he was forced to become a test subject.

Vicious found out they were planning to run away together and confronted Julia, telling her that she would have to kill Spike, or both of them would be killed.

Mad Pierrot was a patient in a program to develop a super soldier. The process was, however, too much for him to handle, and his mental state degraded to an almost vegetative state. As he was transported to his permanent holding cell after being removed from the program, he freed himself and killed everybody he encountered in the facility—all while smiling. Since the experiment made him bulletproof, Pierrot has never felt pain, and thus his mind collapsed when Spike made him suffer a minor leg wound. Pierrot died in a theme park, squashed by a giant robotic dog's foot."

Birth Date: November 23, 1973

Gender: Male
Family: Hiroko Makunouchi (Mother); Kazuo Makunouchi (Father); Wanpo (Pet)
Occupation: Professional Boxer; Makunouchi Fishing Boat
Weight Class: Featherweight
Height: 164 cm (5'5"")
Reach: 165 cm (65"")
Style: Infighter; Peek-A-Boo Style
Current Affiliation: Kamogawa Boxing Gym
Trainer: Genji Kamogawa
Specialty: Liver Blow; Gazelle Punch; Dempsey Roll

Ippo Makunouchi is the main protagonist of the series. He lives with his mother, Hiroko Makunouchi, and helps with the family charter boat fishing business. Ippo is a classic power in-boxer and is well known for his Peek-a-Boo style of boxing and hard punches which include three signature punches: a rib-cracking liver blow, Gazelle punch (an uppercut variant), and the Dempsey roll technique. His signature punches appear to be modelled after Mike Tyson, Floyd Patterson and Jack Dempsey respectively.

Ippo is bullied throughout most of his school life. After being rescued by Takamura, he ends up being brought to Kamogawa Gym, where he displays an explosive punching power. After seeing a video of Mike Tyson, he becomes inspired to take up boxing to feel reborn with strength. He soon proves himself to Takamura and Kamogawa, and starts on the path to being a pro boxer.

His Pro-Debut Match was against Oda Yusuke, He was largely regarded as a lazy and unmotivated boxer, but when his girlfriend threatened to break up with him, he committed himself to training. From the first time the boxers met, there was tension between them, as a misunderstanding led Oda to believe Ippo made fun of him. On the actual fight, Ippo seemed to have the advantage from the beginning of the match, but was saved by his coach from losing the fight due to a cut. Ippo managed a comeback by knocking Oda out with a series of jabs, thus winning the fight.


After winning two fights upon his debut as a pro-boxer, Coach Kamogawa enlisted Ippo in the East Japan Rookie King Tournament. Ippo also had his personal goal in the tournament to fight with Miyata in the Pro Ring for their tie-breaker match. With this promise in mind Ippo aims to reach the East Japan finals. First Round: Jason Ozuma Ozuma is a black officer from America who was stationed in Japan, and the only black boxer Ippo has faced so far. Jason is a very polite and kind man who cares greatly for his gym and friends. His most revered attacks, his devastating Hooks, are comparable to Takamura's in terms of speed. Ippo had to enter an in fight to win the first round. Ippo took major hits, but managed to turn the match around by pressuring Ozuma with his power. After an intense round, Ippo managed to take advantage of Ozuma's wide swing and his delayed punch, due to a broken rib, to deliver a second down and win the match. Second Round: Kobashi Kenta Kobashi Kenta is a boxer that depends on winning with points. Ippo is annoyed by Kobashi's technique, which is to clinch often; eventually Kobashi's strategy, to rob Ippo of his stamina, takes effect. However, in the final round (the 4th round), Kobashi punches Ippo with a counter and becomes excited at the prospect of landing a KO on Ippo. Even though his second disapproved, his desire to gain a KO victory lead him to fight head-on, but Ippo took his chance the instant Kobashi stepped outside the pure, no-risk outboxing and KO'ed him. Semi-final Round: Hayami Ryuuichi A pretty boy boxer who held the title of Inter High Champion with his fast barrage of punches called the Shotgun and Ippo's first opponent as an out boxer. Hayami looked down upon Ippo, and dismissed him since he felt Ippo was an unworthy opponent. Hayami's strategy uses a short uppercut against dashing infighters and finishes them with his Shotgun. Ippo, however, manages to counter him by using a cross hook counter against his short uppercut, and sees through the storm of punches. Having finally mastered bobbing and weaving at the training camp, he was able to avoid and get close to Hayami. Ippo finished the fight with a rush followed by an uppercut to win the fight in 1 round moving to the finals. East Japan Final Round: Mashiba Ryou Ippo's final opponent in the East Japan Rookie King tournament defeated Miyata with a controversial foul and seemed poised to take the Rookie King Title. Ippo met Mashiba at his pro license exam, and has since been afraid of his dark demeanor throughout most of the series (albeit comically), but after witnessing Mashiba's foul, Ippo goes into the match determined to win. Initially, Mashiba's flicker jabs exploited Ippo's short reach by keeping him at bay, but Ippo eventually slipped in, broke Mashiba's elbow (at the expense of his right hand), and slugged it out with him. Ippo gave Mashiba his first and only legitimate black star in the form of a heavy and painful K.O victory.

Since Ippo had broken his fist, the All Japan Round didn't seem like a possibility, but when Ippo met Sendou, the West Japan Rookie King, in person, he decided to go ahead with the fight. He received therapy from Doctor Yamaguchi which allowed him to fight with a proper hand. The match was an intense slug-fight which ended abruptly before the fourth round when Sendou turned out to be unconscious in his corner, despite still sitting upright looking ready to continue.

After winning the All Japan Rookie Tournament, Ippo found that his rival Miyata was going overseas. Ippo was left with no current goal to motivate him. Rehabilitating his hand injured from his previous fight, Ippo breaks from training and starts supporting his fellow boxers at Kamogawa Gym in their fights. He then meets the current National Feather Weight Champion Date Eiji, who hints that in the future they may face each other since Ippo is already ranked number 10 upon winning the Rookie King Tournament. Ippo realizes that he wants to fight the Champion and trains for his new challenge. And he proceeds to do this by entering an A class tournemant and defeating Okita Keigo, Saeki Takuma and Alexander Volg Zangief. Date Eiji After earning his right to challenge Date Eiji, one of Japan's most revered boxers, Ippo went into the match bringing everything he had learned in his past 10 matches with him. For the first few rounds he succeeded in pushing the champion to his limits. However, when Eiji began using the high-level Neck Spin to negate most of the power behind Ippo's punches, Ippo becomes disoriented. Eiji gradually returns to his style of fighting from his younger days. He delivers a powerful Heart Break Shot that stuns Ippo, then prepares to deliver the finishing blow. But the referee stops the match because Kamogawa had already thrown in the towel. Victory goes to Date Eiji. Thanks to this match, Date regains his confidence in challenging the world champion, Ricardo Martinez. He relinquishes his belt, leaving Sendou Takeshi and Alexander Volg Zangief to fight for it. Sendou wins by a controversial decision and becomes the new Japanese Featherweight champion. Ponchai Chuwatana A Thai fighter ranked 3rd in Thailand who faces Ippo following his 5 month break against Date Eiji. Ponchai had a very well-built physique and a strong determination to win in his boxing matches.in the second round, Ippo starts to land small punches while swaying left and right, before speeding up and finishing Ponchai off with his new finishing move, the ""Dempsey Roll.""After this match, Sendou, the new featherweight champion, challenged Ippo to a match personally. Sendou Takeshi The continuation of the unfinished match between the hard punchers of East and West. Ippo and Sendou had been looking forward to a match since the All Japan Rookie Championship was unfinished in their minds. To prepare for the match they both strengthened their weaknesses through new training methods, Sendou improving his lower body and Ippo his upper body. This match is considered to be one of the most intense since both fighters had roughly the same amount of punching power resulting in numerous slug fests and a footstomp from the audience that shook the hall. Ippo originally had problems since he had a smaller body, meaning he had a little bit less muscle and was going to lose unless he started to connect more punches than Sendou did. But with encouragement from his friends and remembering his training he managed to continue his match against Sendou. The match turned into a mix up, where both fighters drew out the others' potential and helped each other grow stronger. With one final showdown between their signature finishers, Ippo managed to pull through and finish Sendou off by inventing a combo of his 3 strongest techniques to take the belt and title. Sendou then personally congratulated Ippo.

After obtaining the National Japanese Feather Weight Belt from Sendou, Ippo defended the title successfully for eight consecutive times.

After yet another canceled fight with Ichiro Miyata, Ippo lost his drive and thought of retiring from boxing. However with the help of Iimura Mari and the words of his friends and previous opponent, he was able to find his true goal which is to become strong and went back to Kamogawa Gym to continue Boxing. Kamogawa then tells Ippo to aim for the World, but having them cut off the shortest route of getting to the top rankings by beating the OPBF Champ Miyata, Kamogawa tells Ippo that he will take a different path, which is to defeat all of the OPBF National Champions, obtaining their WBC rankings and becoming an unofficial OPBF Champion.

After his fight with Kojima, Ippo was told by the coach that he would be relinquishing the JBC Featherweight Title and moving up to challenging world rankers. His first match as a world contender is against Alfredo Gonzales, the 2nd ranked Featherweight in the WBA and 3rd ranked Featherweight in the WBC. in the 7th round, the boxers enter yet another exchange which Ippo wins, but as he goes for the finishing blow, Alfredo lands a powerful right counter and sends Ippo to the canvas, where he lays motionless. Kamogawa runs into the ring to help Ippo and the referee declares a TKO. As of this fight, Alfredo is the second person to knock Ippo unconscious.

Reach: 189 cm (74"")
Style: Hybrid
Stance(s): Orthodox Stance, Brawling Stance, Hitman Style
Current Affiliation: Kamogawa Boxing Gym
Trainer: Kamogawa Genji

He is a multi-weight class (currently middleweight) hybrid boxer affiliated with the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. He is the current unified WBC and WBA Middleweight champion and strongest known character in the series.

Takamura is very hearty, rude and often behaves vulgarly. He is a loud arrogant boaster who tends to refer to himself as Ore-sama (a Japanese name suffix intended for people of great importance) and he rarely ever shows a shred of consideration towards other fighters after a loss.

Takamura was discovered on the streets by Coach Kamogawa Genji, and his speed, power, and technique are all high-level to the point that he is capable of handling both In Fighters and Out Boxers without too much trouble. Unlike most characters in Hajime no Ippo, he has no special finishing blow, but every punch he has possesses killer destructive power. With the wild power to always force out any situation he claims will happen, he is a man who does everything he says he will.

As the one who got Ippo, Aoki and Kimura into boxing, he is well respected at the Kamogawa Gym. Even though he constantly looks down on and ridicules their achievements, his unrivalled strength and the few moments his true kindness leaks out prevent them from losing their respect for him. Takamura loves to pick on his fellow gym mates, with Aoki usually the first on his list. Although he tends to get more serious when hearing about or training for his next match, he still finds the time to play pranks on everyone and goof around.

He is the current WBC and WBA World Middleweight Champion and former WBC Junior Middleweight Champion. He was also the JBC Middleweight Champion, but relinquished it after 4 title defenses. He lives alone at the Ohta Inn apartment complex, and his room is littered with junk, old food, pornography, and even his Belts. He still lives there even after becoming World Champion, preferring a simple life.


Takamura's one weakness is his arrogance and temper, as he is able to be easily provoked by many of his opponents, he also has in two occasions felt the compulsive need to finish his fights with 1-Hit KOs (Due to Miyata getting too much attention, and Ippo scoring a 1-Hit KO), which led to him almost losing against opponents a lot weaker than him. Like Miyata, Takamura is constantly struggling with weight control, so he is prone to losing stamina slightly quicker due to fighting in weight-classes below his natural weight. Aside from that the only times Takamura has been in trouble is when an opponent reads his attacks, but he just keeps trying until he finds a way to connect. In both his matches with Eagle and Bison, Takamura's right eye (or at least his field of vision on his right side) played a key role in his opponents gaining the upper hand. This suggests he may have a detached retina in his right eye, though this is not confirmed by the manga.
The character for Taka (鷹) in his name means hawk, and as a result he is sometimes nicknamed The Japanese Hawk by announcers and spectators (most notably during his matches against Brian Hawk and David Eagle). He lives alone at the Ohta Inn apartment complex, and his room is littered with junk, old food, pornography, and even his boxing belts. His pompadour hairstyle is his trademark.

Stance: Orthodox Stance
Current affiliation: Kamogawa Boxing Gym
Trainer: Shinoda

He is an unorthodox lightweight boxer and one of the core members of the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. He, along with Kimura Tatsuya, are known to have been scouted into boxing by Takamura Mamoru, an individual they swore to defeat but eventually came to admire.

Aoki was a punk from his childhood up through high school, at which point he encountered, fought and got beat down by Takamura Mamoru (who was then a middleweight with two wins under his belt). This loss motivated him to quit school along with his close friend Kimura Tetsuya to become boxers at Kamogawa gym. Although their initial goal was to land a clean hit on Takamura, they grew to love boxing and develop their own skills. Aoki became a clownish boxer whose signature techniques, the Frog Punch and Look-Away, eventually led him to a draw in a Japanese title match with then-champion Imae Katsuka. Currently in the series, Aoki had a going rivalry with Papaya Dachiu, the lightweight champion of the Philippnes, with whom he has drawn two consecutive matches.

In a flashback shown in the series, Aoki is known for his troubled school life as a delinquent. He, along with long-time friend Kimura, were known to participate in countless fights and brawls with 'rival' schools. Throughout the series Aoki has shown a rather playful, immature, and mischievous personality- an attitude he reflects in his boxing matches where (due to his comparatively unexceptional boxing skills) he constantly thinks of methods to to deceive, confuse, or even ridicule opponents to a certain extent. A very long-running gag is that Aoki keeps revealing impressing talents, that sadly have no connection with boxing. Another one involves his girlfriend's friendship with Kumi that has made made contacting her far more easy than Ippo could ever hope, so Aoki often helps him out. His prankster personality extends to his own teammates and is most notably reflected in his attitude towards Makunouchi Ippo and (at times) Takamura Mamoru. Together with Kimura he is paired into the Aokimura duo by Itagaki Manabu.

Aoki's taste in women is seen as a running joke in the Hajime no Ippo series where, in contrast to the tastes of his gym mates, Aoki places his preferences in women considered 'ugly' by everyone else. This may be due to an incident where he was cruelly dumped by a beautiful girl, psychologically turning him to prefer uglier girls. Even though he may have a taste for ""ugly"" girls, he is able to hold a girlfriend, Tomiko, longer then any of the other guys with the exception of Ippo but it remains to be seen if he and Kumi will ultimately be together.


For the most part Aoki's fights in the series are not as major or impactive on the general storyline. However, in his most recent fight against Iga Shinobu (and his coach Kurita Baron, a former member of the Kamogawa Gym), Aoki was beaten badly and landed himself in the hospital. Given the option to retire with Kimura after their considerably lengthy careers Aoki refuses, and is determined then to stay in the lightweight class until he defeats Iga, whom he now considers his goal and rival. Takamura is then seen commenting on how stubborn both Aoki and Kimura are.

Kamogawa Genji is a deuteragonist in Hajime no Ippo. His influence on the story rivals those of Takamura Mamoru's and Miyata Ichirou's; all three inspire Makunouchi Ippo to continue boxing.

Kamogawa is the head coach of the Kamogawa Boxing Gym and is close friends with Nekota Ginpachi and Hama Dankichi. As a coach he is strict and holds high expectations for his trainees but is also shown to genuinely care for the well-being of his fighters (albeit in a more silenced, aloof way), forging a strong bond with each and every one of them through trust and spirit. He possesses an extremely sharp sense for boxing and a large wealth of knowledge in regards to boxing, able to give strategies to his fighters that often cause turnabouts in matches. He is shown throughout the series to be most proud of his two most prominent boxers: Takamura Mamoru and Makunouchi Ippo.

He is a retired boxer who founded the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. He acts as the trainer of both Ippo and Takamura,as well as a cornerman for the boxers under Shinoda Tomoyuki.

Kamogawa worked as a prizefighter in Japan shortly after the end of the Second World War. He has exchanged blows with former prizefighter Nekota Ginpachi multiple times. He was also friends with fellow prizefighter and future trainer Hama Dankichi. During the American occupation of Japan, Kamogawa harboured strong feelings of national pride, refusing to accept food handouts.

Sometime later, Kamogawa opened his own boxing gym, where he trained the future manager of the gym Yagi-chan, the then-OPBF Featherweight champion Miyata-san, and the budding counter specialist Miyata Ichirou. By chance, he encountered Takamura Mamoru and convinced him to enter the world of boxing under his tutorship. Takamura then scouted Aoki Masaru, Kimura Tatsuya, and Makunouchi Ippo to the gym.

Though he chose not to train Itagaki Manabu, he is present in his matches as a cornerman. He is equally as surprised at Itagaki's speed and boxing skills as he is at the talents of his own trainees.

Ippo's senpai and Aoki's best friend. He is the smooth, collected type and a romantic at heart, but trains as hard as anyone. His style incorporates a fast left and faster footwork. In the past, he and Aoki were the toughest high-school thugs around, but now Tatsuya's real job is at his family's flower shop. He is a junior lightweight boxer. Along with Makunouchi Ippo, Takamura Mamoru, Aoki Masaru, and Itagaki Manabu, he rounds out the core members of the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. His main fights in the series are against Mashiba Ryou and Eleki Battery.

Kimura and Aoki Masaru were best friends since kindergarten. In high school they began brawling and causing trouble with students from rival schools, namely North High, which eventually led to their expulsion. Kimura was the most affected by this because he was worried he had disappointed his mother. One day the pair attacked North High's Takamura Mamoru and lost miserably. Seeing Takamura's strength as a boxer, they decided to join the Kamogawa Boxing Gym to try and become strong too.

Kimura became a delincuent beacuse he was bullied by an older boy, and when his father went to confront the boy's father, he was pressured and ended up apologizing, this made Kimura lose all respect for his father, becoming more violent in both his house and in the outside, and decided to quit highschool without his parents knowing.

Like Aoki, his boxing ability is also downplayed for much of the series (albeit not quite as badly). Despite this, he has proven to be a good boxer with solid all-around ability. Miyata stated that as a boxer, Kimura had no weaknesses (despite also not having any strengths) and Miyata's father said that although he was only ranked third before his fight with Mashiba, his talent surpassed that ranking. Mashiba himself admitted that Kimura was his strongest challenger. He shows strength around the level of a national champion, as he was able to draw with Eleki Battery twice and only barely lost to Mashiba.

As fast outboxer, Kimura is often asked to be a sparring partner for as Makunouchi and one time for Miyata, though Kimura benefited more from Miyata's sparring.


After losing to Ryo Mashiba, he announced his retirement from boxing.Shortly after, unable to stay away from boxing, he returned saying he would spell his name in katakana (タツヤ) instead of kanji (達也).


Kimura's main role in the story is that of a supporting character, but upon his and Aoki's second entry into the Class A Tournament, they became directly antagonized by Iga Shinobu and his trainer, Baron Kurita. They are now both aiming to settle their grudge with the duo.

Sendo, Takeshi;Takeshi Sendo (千堂 武士);"Takeshi ""Rocky, Naniwa Tiger"" Sendo";"
Birth date: May 5, 1972
Homeland: Japan, Osaka.
Occupation: Professional Boxer, Marketplace Owner (with grandmother)
Weight Class: Featherweight
Height: 167.5 cm (5'5"")
Reach: 168 cm (66"")
Style In Fighter: Brawling Style, Crouching Style
Stance: Brawling Stance
Current Affiliation: Naniwa Kentou-kai
Trainer: Yanaoka

He is a Featherweight boxer from the Naniwa Kentou Boxing Gym and a former JBC Featherweight Champion. He played the main antagonist during the events of championship road, serving as the second Japanese champion Ippo faced for the title.
Sendou's father was a fireman who died while saving the life of a child. Like Ippo, Sendou looked up to his father greatly, and this loss inspired him to try to be as strong as his father.

Sendo is an In Fighter with arm strength on par with Makunouchi Ippo. To date, he is the only boxer to face Ippo more than once in the pro ring and is his chief rival. Sendo is a featherweight and his most well known move is his powerful smash. He greatly admires boxer Rocky Marciano, to the extent that he will personally point out that he is not the same ""Rocky"" from the film of the same name. He is also a fan of Takamura Mamoru.

He is first introduced watching a tape of Makunouchi Ippo's spectacular KO victory against Mashiba Ryou and, fired up by the tape, decides to go visit Tokyo for a match against Ippo. He leaves half-disappointed however when he learns of Ippo's broken fist, but declares hopefully to Ippo that he would be ""waiting for [him] in Osaka'"" when the time comes for their match, accidentally leaving a bag of souvenirs at the station upon his leave.

Since young, Sendou was known to be rude and problematic, having lead his own delinquent gang in the streets. However, it is mentioned by his grandma that Sendou did so to protect innocent civilians from other delinquent gangs. He and his grandmother run a market place.

Disheartened, Sendou does not put much effort into his training until a package arrives in the mail, along with a letter from Ippo stating that they may be able to have their match after all. Renewed by the prospective match Sendou quickly jumps back into intense training, waiting for the day of his match against Ippo.


Despite all his training for the match, Sendou ultimately loses consciousness in his own corner before the start of the fourth round. However, both fighters agree that unless one collapses in the ring, the fight remains unfinished. The two fighters then anxiously wait for the day of their rematch. Sendou is seen again after Date Eiji's relinquishing of the JBC Featherweight belt. He wins a very close, and controversial, victory by decision against Volg Zangief to acquire the vacant title. His first title defense is against Saeki Takuma, whom he KO's with little difficulty. Afterwards, he is pitted against Shigeta Akira, whose provocations of his and Ippo's style of boxing led Sendou to beat Akira so ferociously that he contracted a fear of being punched (and presumably retired) thereafter. Sendou and Ippo then have their promised rematch for the belt. He once again loses, this time by way of knockout from his 'rival'.

Sendou has a semi-final match before Takamura's world title unification bout against Richard Bison. Because he brawled with Mashiba in the waiting room before the fight, he enters the ring with bruises on his face. He is up against a Mexican World ranker once again, Jose Nargo who is fairly strong as he is ranked 5th in the WBA, who is already called a champ. Also this time to defend his position of being ranked 4th in the WBA. Jose Nargo dominated Sendou for most of the match because of his experience with sparring Ricardo Martinez. After the 8th round, when Sendou saw Ricardo's Manager, Bill Stewart as his second, he then pushes Jose to the corner and using his knuckles started to press into Jose's stomach aggressively, causing extreme pain and giving Sendou the opportunity to knock Jose out. Sendou defends his ranking of being 4th in the WBA, and might proceed to a title match. After defeating Jose Nargo, he then speaks to Bill Stewart, telling him to give a warning to Alfredo Gonzalez, which shocks Bill as he expected the warning to be given to Ricardo. He then goes back to the room, to watch the match of Takamura with Mashiba. To this point they seem to be okay with each other and not fighting as they discuss how tough Richard Bison is, but they will continue after this match as they say with each other silently...
Sendo is modeled after the real-life ""Naniwa Rocky"", boxer turned actor Akai Hidekazu.

Zangief, Alexander Volg;Alexander Volg Zangief (アレクサンドル・ヴォルグ・ザンギエフ);"Alexander Volg ""Red Wolf"" Zangief";"
The World Amateur Champion is a handsome boxer from Russia who excels at outboxing and taking points, but adopts a vicious infighting style when he moves to Japan (Ippo notices how depressed he looks after this happens). Raised by a single mother in a small town near to St. Petersburg, Volg originally takes up boxing in order to provide medical assistance for his seriously ill mom (who coincidentally looks a lot like Hiroko Makunouchi, but with longer and reddish hair), but after consecutive losses to both Ippo and Sendou, he is forced to leave the Otawa Gym and return to Russia, staying by his mother's side until her death. Besides his incredible outboxing technique, Volg's greatest weapon is a vertical combination called ""White Fang"" (a short, quick left uppercut, followed by an incredibly fast and powerful chopping right). Volg later returns to Japan to get his old boxing gloves from Ippo before he goes to America, and ends up helping Ippo train for his upcoming match against Sawamura Ryuhei. Later Volg went to America fighting at the world stage and, under the training of Dankichi Hama, became the 4th ranked IBF Jr. Lightweight fighter. His personality is very humble and polite, though he's a very good boxer, Volg admits that he doesn't really like boxing as it hurts other people (his coach even stated that his greatest weakness is his kindness that made him hold back in matches) but only does it so he can help his ill mother back home but finally comes to realize he has passion for boxing. There was also a running gag at the beginning, related to his rusty Japanese. When Ippo met Volg when he couldn't read kanji in the subway, and few minutes after their first conversation he got in trouble with other native Japanese people for the very same reason.


In chapter 1007, he becomes the World Champion of the IBF Jr. Lightweight"
Miyata, Ichirou;Ichirou Miyata (宮田 一郎);"Ichirou ""The Prince of Counters, The Lightning God"" Miyata";"
Date of birth: August 27, 1973
Nationality: Japanese

Height: 5'7.5"" (172.0 cm)
Reach: 69"" (175.4 cm)
Weight: 126 lbs.
Weight class: Featherweight
Gym affiliation: Kawabara Gym
Specialty: Various counters, Speed Hell
Stance: Orthodox Stance , Detroit Style, Hitman Style (once)


Ichiro Miyata is an out-boxer known for his speed, timing and determination. His normal punches are light but he is an expert at using counters that are all potential Sunday punches. Miyata is one of Ippo's primary goals as a boxer.

Ever since he was little, Miyata has always wanted to be like his dad. His dad, Suzuki Miyata, used to be a boxer, until a career-ending jaw bone injury forced him to retire. Miyata takes his training dead seriously, and has always believed in his father's old beliefs, that skill can beat strength. You hardly ever see the guy smile because he thinks that he doesn't have the privilege to smile unless he wins a boxing match.


He had worked his way up to almost the top of the featherweight Rookie King championship, until Ryo Mashiba beat him in a match. Miyata ended up in the hospital with a broken foot, as well as some other injuries. Miyata then left Japan to fill the gap between himself and Ippo. He now holds the OPBF Featherweight title and has defended it five times. Due to his promise with Ippo and his determination to prove his father's boxing to the world, Miyata restricts himself to the Featherweights and as a consequence suffers from severe weight control, which lowers his match stamina and strength while making him more susceptible to damage.


He was supposed to fight Ippo as promised at that point, but due to a series of events that would come to be called fate, the match didn't happen. Miyata broke his fists in the fight preceding his match with Ippo and took three months off to recover. During that interval, Randy Boy Junior became the Interim Champion. Miyata then cancelled his match with Ippo, much to everyone's confusion."
Mashiba, Ryo;Ryo Mashiba (間柴 了);"Ryo ""Shinigami, The Executioner"" Mashiba";"
Mashiba Ryo is a fictional character from the anime and manga series Hajime No Ippo, and Fighting Spirit . He is one of the darker characters in the series, but has shown his lighter and good natured side from time to time. He lives with his sister, Kumi Mashiba, whom he is very protective of. Their parents are deceased, having died in an accident when Mashiba was in school. He is well known for his hitman style of boxing that utilizes one of his specialties, the flicker jab; both of which appear to be modeled after Thomas Hearns. His other specialty is a close range chopping right."
Date, Eiji;Eiji Date (伊達 英二);Eiji  Date;"
At an age swiftly approaching thirty, Date is an old-timer for a boxer, but is nevertheless the man that Ippo looks up to. Years ago, he lost his World Title Match to the champion, Ricardo Martinez, who was defending his title for the 2nd time. He was knocked out in the 2nd round, and among other injuries, got a scar on the bridge of his then-fractured nose.

Date gave up boxing after that in order to settle down with his wife Aiko (a woman from a rich family who sacrificed a lot to be with him, and who just had a miscarriage at that time) and raise a family. But Date was a born boxer—he found he could not contain his combative nature for long, and after Aiko told him that she wanted their son Yuuji to see his dad fight, he picked his career back up to the top. Date is strong in every way, but his greatest weapon is the Heartbreak Shot, a corkscrew blow to the heart that immobilizes the opponent.


He is the first boxer to have defeated Ippo in the ring, making Kamogawa throw the towel. After this fateful match, Date went after the WBA title—a rematch with Ricardo Martinez, who was making his 18th title defense—but lost by K.O. in the 10th round. The injuries he received in this fight included broken hands and a fractured jaw, and seriously limited Date's chances of making a return to the ring. He has, however, passed on his dream to Ippo. Currently, he trains other boxers at the Nakadai Gym. Morikawa Jouji stated in an interview that Date was modeled after former OPBF Champion Ozaki Fujio. At the time of his retirement, Date held a record of 23-2-0 with 17 KO's. He was the former OPBF Featherweight Champion as well as a two-time JBC Featherweight Champion and has twice been the #1 contender to Ricardo Martinez's WBA Featherweight Title.

San is known as Princess Mononoke, the 17-year-old girl, princess of spirits and beasts. When San was a baby, her parents, along with some other travelers, were attacked by the wolf goddess Moro. Her parents threw San to Moro as a sacrifice to save their own lives, thus escaping while Moro was preoccupied with San.

However, San was spared; Moro did not eat her, instead raising San as her own daughter. San treats Moro as her mother and her two natural pups as brothers. San rejects her own humanity, thinking of herself as a wolf. Possibly because of her past, San hates humans with a great ferocity, even more so than Moro. She wears a coat made of wolf hide, and carries a dagger made from the tooth of a wolf.

San cares very much for the forest she lives in and the animals she lives with. San is very agile, able to dodge arrows, darts, and even ishibiya shots. She, like the Mountain Spirits, wants to destroy the humans so that they will stop taking away all their land. She personally wants to kill Eboshi, the leader of Irontown."

When ""The Iron Works"" was established, Moro had a tendency to tell San to attack the villagers, since they were defiling the forest.

Date of Birth: December 5, 2000 a.t.b. (Sagittarius)
Blood Type: A
Nationality: Britannian
Height: 178-183 cm
Weight: 56 kg
Occupation: Ashford Academy Student
Known Relatives: Charles zi Britannia (father), Marianne vi Britannia (mother, deceased), Nunnally vi Britannia (little sister)
Alter-Ego: Zero
Allegiance: Order of the Black Knights
Position: Order of the Black Knights Leader
Knightmare Frame: Burai, Gawain, Shinkiro
Favourite quote: The only ones who should kill, are those who are prepared to be killed.

Lelouch is introduced in the first episode of the series as a student of Ashford Academy high school, where he is a member of its student council. A brilliant thinker who is quite talented at chess, he lives with his younger sister, Nunnally, with their maid, Sayoko Shinozaki, at a house situated within the compounds of Ashford Academy, where they are looked after by the Ashford family.

Lelouch is soon swept into the conflict between the Britannia Empire and the pockets of resistance which oppose it when he accidentally boards a truck being used by Japanese resistance operatives. Within the truck is a capsule holding C.C., who sacrifices herself to save him from the military forces trying to recapture her. When it seems as if her sacrifice was pointless, C.C. suddenly touches his hand and offers him the ""Power of the King,"" the mythical power of Geass. The Geass manifests itself in him as the power of absolute obedience, which allows him to make people obey his orders without question.

With his new power, Lelouch begins his rebellion against the Empire, forming the Order of the Black Knights and takes up the identity of Zero to lead them, becoming a revolutionary and gaining popular support amongst the people.


Lelouch is the son of the Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia, and the late Imperial Consort Marianne, making Lelouch the eleventh prince of the Britannian Imperial Family. He was seventeenth in line for the throne prior to his mother's assassination and his sister's crippling in the same incident. A ten-year-old Lelouch confronted the Emperor afterward and accused him of leaving his mother defenseless, even going as far as renouncing his entitlement to the throne. In response, his father banished him to Japan, where he was used as a political hostage in the Sakuradite conflict. It was during his stay at the Kururugi household that he first met Suzaku Kururugi, with whom the young Lelouch did not interact initially in a friendly manner, before later becoming friends. However, when Britannia finally developed its Knightmare Frames fleet and decided to invade Japan to seize control of the Sakuradite mines, consequently discarding Lelouch's use as a diplomatic tool, Lelouch, fearing for his and his sister's safety, hid their true identities and sought the help of the Ashford family, who were his mother's allies. His mother's death and his father's apparent lack of concern in regards to it were huge blows to Lelouch. He always felt that it was unfair for both his mother and sister, and therefore made it his goal to pursue a better world for Nunnally. He also seeks to discover the true reason for his mother's death, as she was murdered in the Aries Imperial Palace, a place terrorists would be unlikely to penetrate successfully without being noticed, if at all. Shortly after gaining the power of Geass from C.C., Lelouch assumes the secret identity Zero, a mysterious, masked revolutionary dressed in a black helmet and cloak. The helmet has a retractable plate over the left eye so Lelouch can use his Geass. In this guise, he forms the Order of the Black Knights, initially composed of the members of Kallen Kōzuki's resistance group. The goal of this vigilante group is a campaign against powerful individuals who oppress the helpless, which he eventually expands into reforming Japan as an independent nation. Lelouch is willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish his goal, even if it means lying to his followers and using people as bait for the outcome he desires. However, he has trouble putting those he is close to in harms way for the sake of his goal, which is a weakness as a commander but a remnant of his humanity and sanity. His feelings for Nunnally in particular often hinders his plans, particularly at the end of the first season, where he abandons a massive war with Britannian forces to rescue her. Gradually, however, he has come to embrace the fact that he has to destroy before reconstruction can occur, even if it means harming those he cares about. Originally, Lelouch is motivated by the desire to avenge his mother's death and construct an ideal world where his sister Nunnally can live in peace. After Nunnally becomes Viceroy of Area 11, and her wishes conflict with his goals, his friends help him to realize that his rebellion is no longer just for Nunnally, but for all the people of the world. Following Nunnally's death and the betrayal of the Black Knights, Lelouch focuses on making sure that he at least takes the Emperor down with him. The turning point in his rebellion comes when Euphemia li Britannia declares the region under Mount Fuji the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, giving the Japanese people their name and country back, albeit in a much smaller area. This effectively destroys any possibility of the Black Knights' rebellion; acceptance would render them powerless and refusal would make them pariahs. Lelouch confronts her at the opening ceremony and tries to have her shoot him, hoping to make himself a martyr. When she says she plans to give up her title, he surrenders and agrees to work with her. However, at this moment his Geass permanently activates, and an offhand comment about ordering her to kill the Japanese forces her to do just that. Lelouch reluctantly kills her and uses the massacre as an excuse to declare Japan an independent nation. He then leads an attack on the Tokyo Settlement. The attack goes well at first, but when Lelouch learns that Nunnally has been kidnapped, he abandons the battle, leaving his forces helpless against the much better organized Britannian forces. Lelouch and C.C. make their way to Kaminejima to search for Nunnally, where Lelouch is confronted by Suzaku Kururugi. Lelouch attempts to broker a truce, but Suzaku is distraught over the death of Euphemia and refuses to listen. An angered Lelouch draws his pistol and both Lelouch and Suzaku attempt to shoot one another. A single gunshot is heard as the screen fades to black at the end of the first season.

Season Two:

One year later, Lelouch is living a peaceful life with his younger brother, Rolo Lamperouge, and has no memory of his revolutionary activities, his Geass, Nunnally, his mother, or his royal lineage. Flashbacks reveal that neither Suzaku or Lelouch managed to kill one another. Instead, Lelouch was apprehended and brought before the Emperor, who used his own Geass to wipe Lelouch's memories and suppress his power. Lelouch's memories and Geass are restored by C.C., and he resumes leadership of the Black Knights. To prevent retaliation by the Britannian forces, he makes his base in the Chinese Federation's consulate. When Nunnally is appointed as Viceroy of Area 11, and announces her plans to reestablish the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, Lelouch falls into depression since he would be impeding her wishes by continuing his rebellion. He nearly begins taking Refrain before Kallen stops him. With the help of Kallen and his friends at the Ashford Academy, Lelouch realizes that his mission no longer revolves solely around Nunnally, but concerns the rest of his friends, and the Japanese people as well. To solve both concerns, Lelouch engineers the legal exile of the Black Knights by getting the Britannians to agree to exile Zero in exchange for bringing one million participants for Nunnally's new Japan. By having them all dress as Zero, he forces Suzaku to exile them all rather than order a massacre. Sayoko stays behind as his body double to keep up the illusion that Lelouch and Zero are separate people, though during her short tenure as his impersonator she changes his image into that of an athletic womanizer. The Black Knights escape to the Chinese Federation, where Lelouch begins his plans to win more countries to his side, creating a alliance that can match the Britannian Empire. He starts by overthrowing the High Eunuchs of the Chinese Federation and returning control to Empress Tianzi. He also has a secondary motive in doing so: the Chinese Federation is where V.V.'s Geass Directorate is headquartered. By taking control of the directorate, Lelouch believes he will be able to match the Emperor in both military and Geass might. While the remaining dissident forces are cleaned up, Lelouch returns to Japan to prepare for the invasion by installing Gefjun Disturbers in the mass transit rail system. The combined effect of every train running a Disturber would shut down Tokyo Settlement completely. After Shirley is killed by Rolo, Lelouch abandons his plan to take over the Geass Directorate, instead mounting an all-out assault on their stronghold. He orders the deaths of everyone within, resulting in the death of General Bartley among countless others. V.V. tries to use the Siegfried to buy time for the remaining members to escape, but it is destroyed with the aid of Cornelia while C.C. annihilates the remaining followers. Lelouch chases V.V. back into the temple, where he is unexpectedly teleported to the Sword of Akasha to face the Emperor. Lelouch attempts to kill the Emperor, but he has become immortal like C.C. The Emperor tells Lelouch about the world's lies, and shortly after C.C. arrives, finally revealing the contents of their pact. She would have had Lelouch kill her and take on her immortality, but instead spares him by placing him inside her memories while the Emperor kills her. Lelouch refuses to let her die unhappy and convinces her to live on. Lelouch destroys part of the Sword of Akasha and is transported back to the real world with C.C., but her memories of her life after gaining Geass have been erased. Lelouch then completes ratifying the United Federation of Nations, and their first act is to liberate Japan. To insure Nunnally's safety, Lelouch agrees to meet Suzaku alone at the Kururugi Shrine. Suzaku demands answers about Lelouch's various uses of Geass, but Lelouch lies, claiming that everything he has ever done was purely for selfish reasons. Suzaku realizes that Lelouch is lying and agrees to help, but Prince Schneizel's troops move in to arrest Lelouch, convincing him that Suzaku sold him out. Lelouch escapes with the help of Guilford, having used his Geass to make Guilford see him as Princess Cornelia, and uses the Gefjun Disturber trains to shut down Tokyo Settlement. He resolves to abandon his emotions in order to achieve his goals, having lost his faith in friendship. In the second battle of Tokyo, Lelouch directs his forces to focus on the government building in an effort to secure Nunnally. Suzaku threatens to use the F.L.E.I.J.A. bomb unless Lelouch stands down, but Lelouch merely waves him off as a liar. Once Kallen escapes in her upgraded Guren and Suzaku becomes an obstacle, Lelouch orders her to kill him. As her Knightmare is far more advanced, she nearly succeeds. Suzaku's imminent defeat activates his Geass command, causing him to launch F.L.E.I.J.A. The bomb engulfs the government complex, killing Nunnally among countless others. Lelouch goes into a nervous breakdown at the thought, refusing to believe that Nunnally could be dead. His identity is then exposed by Schneizel and the Black Knights betray him. Rolo evacuates him, but dies in the attempt. In the end, Lelouch comes to terms with his feelings for Rolo. Having lost everything as retribution for his acts, he realizes that the last thing he must do is drag his father into hell with him. With his renewed purpose, Lelouch quickly sets off to defeat the Emperor, throwing the Britannian ranks into chaos by using his Geass to make numerous soldiers slaves to his will. As the Britannian forces battle one another, Lelouch confronts the Emperor in the Sword of Akasha, sealing the entrance behind him so they will both be trapped for eternity.

Geass:
Lelouch's Geass, given to him by C.C., grants him ""the power of absolute obedience,"" allowing him to plant commands within a person's mind upon eye contact which they will obey without question. Activation of his Geass is visually represented by the manifestation of a Geass sigil in his left eye. Commands dictated in this state are written into the minds of the designated targets once the sigil projects from his eye to theirs. Lelouch could initially toggle Geass activation at will, but subsequently loses this control to an affliction known as Geass runaway.


In the second season, C.C. gives Lelouch a contact lens that blocks his Geass, but indicates that his Geass will eventually grow powerful enough to render it ineffective.
Of all the Geass abilities in the series, Lelouch's has been explored the most, and also seems to have the most restrictions and side effects of any Geass introduced.

* Commands must be issued verbally.
* The victim must make direct eye contact for commands to be issued. The maximum effective distance is 270 meters. Line of sight via a reflective surface is sufficient for the effect to occur.
* Commands may be issued only once to any given individual, but any number of commands may be issued at initial application so long as eye contact is unbroken. Since Jeremiah's Geass Canceller negates all Geass effects, those exposed to it may be commanded once again.
* The victim will not perform any action disallowed by their physical or mental capabilities, though they will try to carry out the command to the best of their ability. For example, a victim will not be able to correctly answer a question they don't know the answer to, but will direct the user to someone who can if they are able. However, commands that affect the mind or consciousness, such as telling the victim to forget something, will take effect despite the fact that the victim could not normally force themselves to do so.
* An action will be carried out for as long as dictated in its command, or upon the indicated conditional circumstance. Eye contact does not need to be maintained for command execution to occur. No upper limit has been established, but the conditional command Lelouch gives Suzaku is still in effect more than a year later.
* The victim's memories for the duration of command issue and execution are sealed and cannot be recalled.
* A victim may resist a commanded action to some degree if it is utterly repugnant to them.

So long as the above conditions are met, commands may be issued to anybody besides those who have gained the power of immortality and to any number of individuals at once. Those under the effect of Geass have a red outline on their pupils, presumably a visual cue for the viewer since the characters never point it out.

Even without his Geass, Lelouch is a formidable opponent. He is highly intelligent, possessing a genius-level intellect, and is capable of devising and executing strategies with incredible speed and precision. Rolo notes that operating the Absolute Defense Territory of the Shinkirō requires complex calculations which he cannot perform, while Lelouch almost makes it look easy. In the audio dramas, Suzaku says that, when they were children, Lelouch devised a secret sign language containing over 500 words.

Lelouch is quick to deduce facts from simple clues. In episode 14, when Mao says C.C.'s name, Lelouch instantly comes up with fourteen different possibilities for Mao's identity, including the correct one. Lelouch is also able to predict the Lancelot's actions exactly through his study of their past battles, allowing Kallen and the Four Holy Swords to almost defeat it (only Suzaku's reflexes saved his life).

Lelouch is also charismatic and persuasive; as Zero, he is able to win the support of much of Japan's population through well-delivered speeches combined with his ability to make miracles in almost any situation through his superior tactical planning. Mao repeatedly praises Lelouch's persuasive talent, and V.V. remarks that Lelouch is ""a lot like his father.""

Physically, Lelouch is underwhelming. He possesses the physical prowess of a teenager who engages in little to no strenuous physical activity. Thus, one of Lelouch's traits is the inability to run very fast or for any substantial period of time. Within the series, this is usually played for comedic effect, as Lelouch is constantly outpaced by his classmates in every situation, and even the most simple tasks requiring manual labor exhaust him before he manages to accomplish anything significant. This joke is taken to its logical conclusion in the second season, where it is revealed that Lelouch is supposed to attend remedial physical education classes, but skips them as often as possible. This creates problems when Sayoko poses as Lelouch: she is a master of martial arts, and hence far more athletic than Lelouch himself. Lelouch laments the problem and decides to have Sayoko attend his gym classes to fix it.

Lelouch is also shown to be very talented at most domestic skills, including cooking and sewing; it has been stated that this comes as a result of his taking care of himself and Nunnally for seven years. He has been shown to be an excellent cook, and is usually the one cooking the food for parties held by the Student Council, both because the others (except Milly) are terrible cooks and nobody else can meet his exacting requirements (such as measuring ingredients to three significant decimals).

Lelouch also has some skill with firearms, usually brandishing a Britannian pistol when threatening someone. His Knightmare piloting skill has been shown to be proficient but not exceptional; he is a capable pilot by himself, though he tends to be overwhelmed by Suzaku and other pilots with more advanced Knightmares at their disposal. When Lelouch pilots a standard Knightmare on the battlefield, he is typically accompanied by Kallen, who is an elite Knightmare pilot and the leader of his personal squad, Squad Zero.


After stealing the Gawain, Lelouch co-pilots it with C.C., controlling the weapons and command functions while C.C. handles navigation and flight. After the Black Knights are exiled from Japan, Lelouch pilots the Shinkirō, which has the most powerful defense of any Knightmare. At the end of season 2, Lelouch ordered Suzaku to kill him so that his sins and all the people's hatred will disappear and he will be free. Killing him will be a key to future happiness."

C.C. is apparently immortal, healing from any wound (implied to include beheading) with enough time. She also doesn't age. Apart from her immortality, C.C. has the ability to bestow people with the power of Geass, which manifests differently in each person but generally carries the ability to affect the minds of those it is used on in some way. The Geass sigil glows on her forehead whenever she manifests this power, and she has a similar scar on her left breast. It is hinted that many more like her exist, as shown in her memories of many children with similar sigils, and she suggests that the power has precipitated bloody conflicts in the past. Her powers caught the interest of Britannia, who imprisoned her for experimentation purposes.


Before she gained the power of Geass, C.C. was a ten-year old escaped slave. A church nun gave C.C. the power of Geass, making everyone around her fall in love with her. Once C.C.'s power evolved to its highest point and she grew tired of all the proposals and gifts, the nun transferred her immortality to C.C., allowing her to die while leaving C.C. in the position of repeating the cycle. In the first season finale, C.C. triggers a trap set by V.V., causing herself and Lelouch to be submerged in a shock image sequence similar to the one she used on Suzaku. Through this, Lelouch sees memories of her past, including repeated ""deaths"". One shows C.C. attempting to escape from a battlefield, only to be shot in the forehead. Further memories show her being persecuted as a witch and suffering various forms of torture and/or execution throughout history and various time periods, including burning at the stake, guillotining, and the iron maiden. This would suggest a minimum lifespan of at least six centuries. In a special feature included in the series' fifth DVD, she and Lelouch discuss Washington's Rebellion, during which she speaks of participants such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin as if she had been close friends with both. In the past, she appears to have observed Suzaku and Lelouch when they were both children, having even interacted with Lelouch at one point, though he doesn't remember their meeting.
Her individual experiences have led C.C. to become a detached and lonely individual, with little care for even those she has entered into contracts with, while in the past she was somewhat a spoiled and cheerful girl. She tells Lelouch that she has been alive so long that she can no longer remember who loves her and who hates her. Due to her nature and history, she has been lonely as long as she can remember. Lelouch replies, ""You're not alone. We are partners. If you are a witch, then I shall become a demon."" Lelouch is possibly the first person that has ever truly cared for her and it appears that she reciprocates at least some of these feelings, as she unexpectedly kisses him after their memories are shared.

C.C. has a strong penchant for pizza, especially Pizza Hut's (which sponsors the show in Japan, though the logo is blurred out in the English dub); she constantly orders pizzas to Lelouch's house using his credit card. She also carries around a stuffed toy of ""Cheese-kun"", the company's mascot in Japan. Her love of pizza is often used for comedic effect, as she was twice willing to risk capture simply to get a piece of a giant pizza being made by the Student Council (which is ruined both times); she doesn't trust Lelouch to retrieve it for her. Both Lelouch and Kallen sometimes refer to her as ""Pizza Girl.""


When left alone, she has sometimes spoken to a previously unknown person through means unknown, which, in episode 23, was revealed to be Marianne, Lelouch's deceased mother, although in episode 19 it appears that she is talking to V.V. as well. According to the DVD Magazine 02, she is talking to more than one person when she seems to be talking to herself. In the past, it was shown that she and Marianne were close."

Age:
17 (season 1) 18 (season 2)

Zodiac Sign:
Aries

Blood Type:
B

Height:
173 cm (5'8"")

Birth date:
March 29, 2000

A Britannian-Eleven girl, who believes herself to be a Japanese person at heart. Before the Britannia Empire conquered Area 11, Kallen's original name was Karen Kouzuki. She comes from a prestigious family and attends the Ashford Academy where she receives outstanding grades while serving as a member of its Student Council. When away from the Academy, she fights as an anti-Britannian operative. Also, Kallen helped organize the Black Knights.

Her brother, Naoto Kouzuki, with whom she had a deep connection, was a former leader of her resistance cell before his death.

Both Kallen's stepmother, a Britannian, and biological mother live with her in the same house, but her biological mother is employed as a maid and is often mistreated by both her stepmother and Kallen herself. After her biological mother is arrested for using Refrain (a fictional drug which lets people think they're reliving the past), Kallen changes her views and decides to fight against the Britannian Empire not only for her brother, but to fulfill her new wish for a world in which she can live happily with her biological mother.

Frail and meek, this aspect of Kallen's character was used as a public front to mask her true nature as well as hide her involvement in the resistance.

Kallen leads a double life as a normal Britannian student and as a member of a guerrilla resistance group against Britannia, which is later reformed into the Order of the Black Knights by Lelouch Lamperouge. In school, she portrays herself as a weak-bodied high school student who obeys all of the formalities, and goes by her Britannian name of Stadtfeld. However, her personality changes in to a very strong-willed and forceful one when she acts as a resistance fighter.

As a running gag, Kallen ends up nude or immodestly dressed in front of other people on numerous occasions: Lelouch sees her naked after she pulls back a shower curtain in surprise in the third episode, Suzaku sees her bathing under a waterfall when they are stranded on Kaminejima, she is forced to dress in an immodest bunny costume at the start of the second season (to plant a tracking device on Lelouch), and she walks in on a meeting between C.C. and the Chinese ambassadors wearing only a towel when intending to complain about the previous situation to C.C. (claiming that the operation would've gone faster if C.C. was wearing the outfit).

In an interview reported by the anime magazine Newtype USA, seiyu Ami Koshimizu talked about the difficulty of voicing Kallen because of the double life that her character leads. Certain aspects of Kallen's character such as her girlish naivete and competitiveness made it easy for the voice actress to relate, even to the point of admitting that in some ways they act very much the same."

Knightmare frame: Lancelot and Lancelot Albion

Lelouch's childhood friend and son of Japan's last prime minister. After Britannia's takeover of Japan, Suzaku joins the Britannia Army and becomes an Honorary Britannian. He agrees with Zero (Lelouch in disguise, unknown to Suzaku) with his assertion that the Britannia Empire is not worth serving, but nevertheless wishes to implement changes and improvements from within the empire, all the while trying not to lose sight of his goals lest his father's death have been in vain. He has a strong sense of justice and is the only one known to be able to pilot the elite Britannian Knightmare Frame, Lancelot. He always keeps with him a broken pocket watch, a memento of his deceased father.


He is in love with Euphemia and is devastated upon her death. He swears revenge against Zero, for killing her. In the last episode of R2, Lelouch asks Suzaku to kill him (as all of the world's hatred is now focused upon him) and to become Zero. Suzaku kills Lelouch in front of all the Black Knights and Nunnally at a parade held for Lelouch. After Lelouch dies, Suzaku takes care of Nunnally as Zero and leads the Black Knights.

An elite Knightmare Frame pilot and a Purist, who is deeply concerned with the Purists' supremacy - enough to use Suzaku as a scapegoat for both avenging Clovis' death and reinforcing the Purists' superiority in Area 11. Initially, he held the rank of Margrave in Area 11's military hierarchy. After Clovis' murder, Jeremiah takes upon the role of Area 11's Acting-Consul, but upon the Zero fiasco, Jeremiah falls into disgrace (due to his incomprehensible actions caused by Lelouch's geass), is targeted for termination by his fellow Purist officers, demoted to the rank of a mere Knightmare Frame pilot and referred mockingly as Orange or Orange-Kun by both his superiors and his fellow knightmare pilots.


In the second season he came back as a machine-like man having the ability to use Geass Canceller. At the end of episode 13 it is seen that he joins Zero's side after revealing that on the day Empress Marianne was killed, he attempted to rescue her but failed. He came back as a member of the Knightmare Frame pilot to atone for his inability to rescue her.

Once Zero Requiem was completed, Jeremiah and Anya start a new life on an orange farm, supposedly a pun for his name.

Age: 17 (18 in R2)

Date of Birth: July 9 as family (July 8 as real birthday)
Blood Type: A
Height: 175 cm (5'9"")

Shirley Fenette is a typical, all-around nice girl who is exceptionally friendly and loves her friends. She is a member of the swimming club. She admits to being infatuated with Lelouch since his enrollment on campus, but finds it extremely hard to get his attention. She has a habit of jumping to conclusions before people can explain things to her, particularly when Lelouch is concerned. Shirley was awarded 19th place in the 29th Anime Grand Prix for Favorite Female Character.


Shirley has a major role in the middle of the first season. After the Black Knights, led by Lelouch's alter ego Zero, indirectly cause the death of her father during the Battle of Narita, Villetta Nu suggests that Lelouch may be involved with the Black Knights, so Shirley follows him and discovers that he is in fact Zero. When Villetta covertly follows her and attempts to arrest Lelouch, Shirley shoots her to protect him. She tries to write a letter about her feelings on the situation to Lelouch, only to throw it aside. Mao uses his mind-reading Geass to manipulate her into killing Lelouch, but she cannot bring herself to do so. To alleviate her suffering, Lelouch uses his Geass to erase Shirley's memories of him. Lelouch expresses regret for having to do so, and even quietly suggests that he might have loved her. Shirley rediscovers her letter near the end of the first season, but cannot confront Lelouch about it because of the rebellion that takes place. In the second season, Shirley's memories, along with the rest of Ashford's Student Council, have been rewritten by the Emperor, erasing her memories of Zero's identity for the second time. Her affection for Lelouch has returned over the intermidiate year. Her memories are restored by Jeremiah Gottwald's Geass Canceller. After coming to terms with it, she comes to understand Lelouch's motivations and forgives him after realizing that he is alone in his quest. She resolves to support him as the one true thing in his life, but runs into Rolo; when she mentions that she wants to help Lelouch reunite with Nunnally, he mortally wounds her. She confesses her feelings to Lelouch when he finds her, and dies in his arms despite Lelouch's desperate attempts to command her to live. Her death was officially ruled as a suicide by a coroner."

Blood type: AB

Lloyd Asplund is an earl of the Britannian nobility and the developer of the elite Knightmare Frame Lancelot. To keep from being reminded of the fragility of human lives and friendship, Lloyd immerses himself in science and has come to view people as nothing more than tools — he regards Suzaku, for example, as a mere component of the machine that he pilots. He has a tendency to mock others and is often rebuked for this behavior by Cécile Croomy, his assistant. Prior to joining the military, he attended the Imperial Colchester Institute. Lloyd's research organization, Camelot is an irregular division of the Britannian Military and has been granted permission by Prince Schneizel to operate outside the command structure and regulations of the regular Britannian armed forces.

Rakshata refers to Lloyd as the Earl of Pudding, as pudding is his favorite food.
He is engaged to wed Milly Ashford in the first season, having agreed to the union mostly in hope that he might obtain the designs of the Knightmare Frame Ganymede. As such, he is forced into doing nice things for her by Suzaku, though Milly breaks off the engagement after she graduates."

Euphemia li Britannia is Lelouch's half-sister and the Third Princess of the Britannian Imperial Family; she is the sibling Lelouch cares most about after Nunnally. She is a kindhearted and open-minded woman who despises conflict in any form.

Euphemia joins her older sister Cornelia in governing Area 11, becoming the Sub-Vicereine. She develops a relationship with Suzaku Kururugi, whose views reflect her own, and eventually appoints him as her personal Knight.


She loves Suzaku Kururugi and declares her love to him in episode 20. Towards the end of the first season, she announces her intent to form the Special Administrative Zone of Japan in the region under Mount Fuji, giving the Japanese people their name and country back. During the administration changeover ceremony, she falls under the accidental influence of Lelouch's Geass and is compelled to kill the Japanese people. She is shot by Zero to stop the ensuing chaos and dies from her injuries, sparking the Black Rebellion. In supplementary materials, it is revealed that Britannia officially declared Euphemia responsible for the massacre and that she had been deprived of royal status and executed by the Britannian Army following the rebellion. She comes to be known as the ""Massacre Princess"" to the general public."

Nunnally vi Britannia is a royal princess born to the Emperor of Britannia, Charles Di Britannia, and Marianne Vi Britannia. She was 87th in line of succession to the Britannia Throne before she and her brother were exiled to Japan as political prisoners. She is Lelouch's younger sister who is wheelchair-bound due to old bullet wounds on her legs, and blind due to psychological trauma while witnessing the brutal murder of her mother, Marianne Vi Britannia. Lelouch believes that she may be able to see again someday. After the confrontation of Lelouch with the Emperor of Britannia about the murder of their mother, both Lelouch and Nunnally were sent to Japan as political trade. They then went on to live in Kururugi Residence where she first met Suzaku Kururugi.

After Britannia invades Japan, Lelouch hides their identity in fear of their safety and changes their surname to Lamperouge. They then seek help from Marianne's old allies, the Ashford family, who kept their identity a secret and allows the two siblings to live in a building on campus to accommodate her disabilities. Nunnally attends Ashford Academy's middle school and is friends with Lelouch's classmates, particularly with Shirley. She is very kindhearted and calls the Elevens ""Japanese people.""

She is also the reason why Lelouch wants to revolt against Britannia. Lelouch wants to build a better world for Nunnally. In episode 24, despite the fact that the The Black Knights were on the verge of winning, Lelouch abandons them to rescue Nunnally after learning of her being kidnapped by V.V.


In the beginning of R2, it seems that nobody at Ashford Academy remembers her existence; everyone apparently recognizes that Lelouch has a younger brother, Rolo, instead of Nunnally. After recovering his memory, Lelouch deduces that Nunnally is likely being held hostage by the Emperor, who would not hesitate to use his children to achieve his goals. As a result, Lelouch must try to maintain the masquerade that he has not regained his memories in order to protect her.


Nunnally makes her first appearances in episode 5 of R2, revealing that she still recalls who Lelouch is, addressing him as her older brother, and shocks Lelouch with the revelation that she has been assigned to become the new Governor-General of Area 11. Nunnally discloses her own decision to become Governor of Area 11. Much to the shock of Lelouch, she decides to continue her late sister Princess Euphemia's will by reinstating the Special Administrative Region in Japan, sharing her and Suzaku's belief that the world can be changed in gentle ways. Currently, however, Nunnally has yet to know of the true identity of Zero and the existence of the Geass, but she heard Lelouch's voice when the ship exploded alluding to the possibility that she does. Her Imperial Name and status was also restored."

Himura, Kenshin;Kenshin Himura (緋村 剣心);"Kenshin ""Hitokiri Battousai, Himura Battousai, Shinta, Ken-san"" Himura";"
Age: 28
Birthday: June 20, 1849
Height: 158 cm
Weight: 48 kg

Kenshin Himura, also known throughout the anime as Hitokiri Battousai (Battousai the Manslayer) or Himura the Battousai is the main character of the anime series Rurouni Kenshin. His original name was Shinta (心太). His parents died of cholera when he was very young and as a result, was adopted by three slave women in a traveling slave wagon. Soon after meeting them, bandits had raided the convoy and killed his three new guardians and were about to kill him when a man named Seijuro Hiko killed the bandits. Hiko soon adopted the child and because Shinta was not a name fitted for a swordman, he renamed him Kenshin, meaning ""Heart of Sword,"" took him under his wing and taught him the Hiten Mitsuruugi Ryu.


However, before full completion of the sword style could be passed on to Kenshin, the Japanese Revolution had been happening at the time and right before Kenshin's eyes. Because of his kind nature and seeing people suffering, he knew he needed to do something about it. He left in the middle of his training and without his master's blessing and joined the Imperialists. It was during the Revolution where Kenshin met Tomoe, his first love and wife. (See Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal OVAs). During the revolution, Kenshin was given the nickname of Hitokiri Battousai because of his god-like speed of drawing a sword to kill the enemy instantly. After helping the Imperialist to a position where they would undoubtedly win the revolution, Kenshin left the revolution all-together with a vow to never kill again and the reverse-blade sword handed to him by Shakku-dono. It was Tomoe's death by his hands that pushed him over the edge of never to kill again.
The next time Kenshin is seen is 10 years later as he has become a wanderer who helps out anyone in need who is suffering right before his eyes. Those long 10 years have taken him from Kyoto, all over Japan to where we find him in episode one of the anime, in Tokyo, still keeping his vow never to kill again. It is here where he meets Kaoru Kamiya and his whole life begins to change once again. (See Rurouni Kenshin anime).

Kenshin is usually depicted as a care-free swordsman who is very aloof and tends to be a bit simple-minded when it comes to living normally. He is seen to be doing many of the chores around the dojo that he stays at with Kaoru, (i.e., cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc.). He believes it is his way of repaying Kaoru with allowing him to stay at her dojo. (although it seems he has gotten attracted to kaoru in the end).

However, his swordsmanship ranks among the elite as he is seen defeating every rival (with the exception of Hajime Saitou which ended in a draw). His battle senses are top-notch and he recognizes even the slightest of advantages, strategies and tactics during a sword battle.

Yukishiro, Tomoe;Tomoe Yukishiro (雪代 巴);Tomoe  Yukishiro;"
Yukishiro Tomoe was the eldest daughter of a samurai, a low-level bureaucrat who served the Tokugawa Shogunate in Edo. Her only sibling was her younger brother Enishi, who viewed her as a surrogate parent because of their mother's death shortly after his birth.
As required by the Shogunate, she practiced Buddhism. She kept diaries to record her inner thoughts and emotions, which she found difficult to express more openly.


This reticence left Kiyosato unaware of how much she truly loved him. Thinking that he needed to please her with greater accomplishments, he went to Kyoto to join the Mimawarigumi and was killed by the Ishin Shishi assassin, Hitokiri Battōsai (Himura Kenshin), but also gave the Hitokiri a single slash scar along the face. Tomoe had met Kenshin shortly after the killing, and went undercover for some time, pretending not to know that Kenshin was the man who had killed her fiance. As a result of the suspicion, she and Kenshin left Kyoto and married, hiding in wait while Tomoe planned Kenshin' death. When the time came for Tomoe to reveal her secrets and kill Kenshin, she had already realized that she had fallen for him, and to save his life, she gave away hers, etching the second scar across his cheek so he would never forget her love.

Saitou, Hajime;Hajime Saitou (斎藤 一);"Hajime ""Gorou Fujita"" Saitou";"
Hajime Saitou is loosely based on the real third-squad captain of the Shinsengumi. During the Meiji era, he lived as a police officer under the name of Gorou Fujita. In the Rurouni Kenshin series, he plays the role of Kenshin's old rival and enemy from the Bakumatsu. He has no compassion or mercy for his enemies and he lives by the Shinsengumi code ""Aku Soku Zan (悪即斬),"" literally ""Slay Evil Immediately,"" but more poetically rendered as ""Swift Death To Evil."" His signature technique is the Gatotsu, a left-handed thrust and a variation of the Hirazuki technique developed by Toshizou Hijikata, the Vice Commander of the Shinsengumi. Although the Gatotsu is a fictional technique only found within the Rurouni Kenshin series, the Hirazuki is a real technique that was used by many of the Shinsengumi members."
Shishio, Makoto;Makoto Shishio (志々雄真実);Makoto  Shishio;"
After the death of Yukishiro Tomoe, Himura Kenshin became a free wielding swordsman to protect members of the Ishin Shishi. Shishio Makoto became his successor as the shadow hitokiri (assassin) and was responsible for the assassination of Izuka, the man who had betrayed the shishi.

The future Meiji government was more secretive about Shishio than Kenshin; many members of the Chōshū and Satsuma clans (the members of the future Meiji government) would have very little information on him.

Later, the new Meiji government believed it would be in their best interests to eliminate Shishio before he became too powerful since Shishio was a man who desired power. Thus during the Boshin War, Shishio was rendered unconscious by several gunshots, doused in oil and burned alive by the new government formed by the Ishin Shishi. He survived, sustaining severe damage to his entire body. Afterwards, he assembled a group of the best fighters in Japan, called the Juppongatana (Ten Swords), to overthrow the Meiji government.

Shishio envisioned a Japan ruled by him, enforcing the principles of natural selection, or what he called ""the strong eat the weak"". Using this belief he ran a campaign against the Meiji government, as he felt it was too weak to effectively lead the country. Using his motto, he molded an ideological disciple out of Seta Sōjirō, who served as his right-hand man, and the strongest of the Juppongatana. He planned to strengthen the economy with petroleum once he took over the country."
Hiko, Seijuurou;Seijuurou Hiko (比古 清十郎);"Seijuurou ""Niitsu Kakunoshin"" Hiko";"
The thirteenth successor to the sword art of Hiten Mitsurugi-Ryuu, Hiko Seijuurou saved young Shinta from marauding bandits who killed his companions. Hiko then took care of Shinta, and renamed him Kenshin (""Heart of Sword"") after claiming that Shinta was not a good name for a swordsman. He became angry and disappointed with Kenshin, because he ran away to join the rebellion against the Tokugawa regime. He shut himself away from the rest of the world; he lives as a potter close to the forest near Kyoto. In Seisouhen/Reflection, he also realizes that the Hiten Mitsurugi-Ryuu no longer seems relevant in the changing world, as he remarks to Yahiko: ""The only thing that doesn't seem to change is the moon.""

Hiko is perhaps the strongest swordsman around; he is far superior even to Kenshin. Although the two are comparable in speed, Hiko possesses a superior sense of judgement in combat and the superhuman strength (hidden, and even suppressed, underneath his heavy cloak) to wield Hiten Mitsurugi Ryuu to its maximum. After fifteen years, master and student meet once more. It is then that Kenshin will complete his training, if Kenshin can survive Hiko's ego.

The cloak is not only distinctive for all Hiten Mitsurugi masters, but it also serves to strengthen them in peacetime. Even when conflict is not at the door, Hiko remains in training just by wearing it, as it is composed of several heavy materials that weigh him down and force him to work out because of counter-springs with pressure of around 37.5 kilograms. Watsuki mentions in the manga that he based the billowy capes' image on Spawn of Image Comics by Todd McFarlane (the size of the collar pieces was reduced in the anime).

The name Hiko Seijuro is in fact a title granted to each succeeding master of Hiten Mitsurugi-Ryuu. Since Hiko Seijuurou II, each new master has discarded his own name in favor of the name of the creator of Hiten Mitsurugi-Ryuu. As Kenshin declines to take the name ""Hiko Seijuurou XIV"", his master is the last man ever to be known as Hiko Seijuurou."
Yukishiro, Enishi;Enishi Yukishiro (雪代 縁);"Enishi ""Mr. Black Shades"" Yukishiro";"
When Enishi was an infant, his mother died and he was raised by his older sister, Tomoe. She raised him herself, becoming both sister and mother to him, and he grew to love her quite dearly.

When Tomoe became engaged to Kiyosato Akira, Enishi reluctantly accepted him because Kiyosato truly made Tomoe happy and she loved him. Kiyosato later joined the Mimawarigumi believing that the sombre Tomoe would be happy if he became a hero, only to be killed by Hitokiri Battōsai (Himura Kenshin) for the new era. Tomoe leaves her brother behind to seek revenge, working with spies from the Shogunate to do so. Enishi becomes consumed by his loneliness to bring her back to Edo (now Tokyo) so they could be together.


When he was about ten, Enishi ran away from Edo, disappearing for seven months. He discovered the location of Tomoe through the Shogun agency and soon appeared before her, revealing that he was the Shogun agency's contact sent to Tomoe. While he believed that he was helping Tomoe's revenge, he did not know Tomoe had grown to love Kenshin, despite the fact he killed Kiyosato. She sends him away, hoping to protect Kenshin, and leaving her brother angry and confused by her actions. After witnessing Kenshin's accidental killing of Tomoe, his hair turns snow white from the stress and grief of losing her. Enishi becomes more unstable and swears Jinchū (Man's Punishment), to be brought down on Kenshin's head for destroying his sister's happiness and then killing her. He disappears to China where he is taken in by a kind and wealthy family after suffering months of hardship in the wilderness. He later kills them all and takes their money, unable to bear seeing how happy they were. In 1878, he returns to Japan after becoming a powerful overlord in the Chinese underworld (almost forgetting to how to speak Japanese in the process) and begins his Jinchu campaign with his ""comrades"".

Okita, Souji;Souji Okita (沖田 総司);Souji  Okita;"
A genius swordsman of the Shinsengumi and master of the Tennen-rishin ryu sword style. Okita was the captain of Shinsengumi's First Unit. In the OVA, he often fought together with Saito and was involved in the Ikedaya Affair in 1864. On one of his night encounters with Kenshin, he eagerly draws his sword and comments that Kenshin's Hiten Mitsurugi-Ryuu gets better every time he sees it."
Takasugi, Shinsaku;Shinsaku Takasugi (高杉 晋作);Shinsaku  Takasugi;"
Takasugi originated the revolutionary idea of auxiliary irregular militia (shotai). Under the feudal system, only the samurai class was allowed to own weapons. Takasugi promoted the recruitment of commoners into new, socially-mixed paramilitary units. In these units, neither recruitment nor promotion depended (at least in theory), on social status. Farmers, merchants, carpenters and even sumo-wrestlers and Buddhist priests were enlisted, although samurai still formed the majority in most of the Shotai. Takasugi clearly saw that utilization of the financial wealth of the middle-class merchants and farmers could increase the military strength of the domain, without weakening its finances. Since the leaders of Chōshū were unable - and unwilling - to change the social structure of the domain, limited use of peasants and commoners enabled them to form a new type of military without disturbing the traditional society.

In 1863, Takasugi himself founded a special Shotai unit under his direct command called the Kiheitai, which consisted of 300 soldiers (about half of whom were samurai). Weakened by the punitive attack by the Western powers, Chōshū was unable to withstand an expedition mounted by the Bakufu in autumn 1864 in retaliation for previous Chōshū attempts to seize control of Kyoto. At first, conservative forces, which favored conciliation with the Bakufu in order to secure the domain, were dominant in Chōshū politics, and Takasugi and some of his compatriots had to leave the domain to avoid renewed imprisonment. Takasugi, with only about a dozen followers, including future political leaders Yamagata Aritomo, Itō Hirobumi and Inoue Kaoru, gathered in Kokura in Kyūshū and prepared an attack on the conservative forces in Chōshū. The subsequent Chōshū civil war began on 13 January 1865.

Takasugi played a major role in this civil war and his Kiheitai militia proved its superiority over old-fashioned samurai forces. With a series of quick strikes and the support of Kido Takayoshi, Takasugi achieved victory by March 1865. He became one of the main arbiters of the Chōshū domain's policy and continued to act as the domain's expert on Western military science, devoting his efforts to importing arms and raising troops. These reforms proved to be successful when Chōshū was victorious on four fronts against the Bakufu's Second Chōshū expedition in 1866, with the Kiheitai itself securing victory on two fronts. Takasugi’s efforts had made a small-scale ‘nation in arms’ out of Chōshū, giving it a military strength out of proportion to its relatively small size. With its victory over the Tokugawa forces, the military power of the Bakufu was discredited, and traditionally rival domains decided to join forces with Chōshū in the subsequent battles which led to the Meiji Restoration and the end of the Tokugawa Bakufu."
Tatsumi;Tatsumi  ;Tatsumi  ;"
A hulk of a man, Tatsumi is the leader of the ninja clan Kenshin fights when looking for Tomoe. In the OVA, he is represented as a physically-fit old man with a ninja outfit who gives Kenshin the beating of his life before Kenshin kills him. His character cares a lot about the Tokugawa values. It should also be noted that in the OVA, he talks a lot, while all other members of his gang are never shown speaking.

In the manga, he is depicted (much like many of Kenshin's other enemies) as someone (literally) twice his size. His outfit is more like a judo outfit than (similar to Inui Banjin) a ninja outfit and he lacks pupils. He was the master of Inui Banjin and his death at the hands of Kenshin is used as an excuse by his student to join Enishi's Jinchu campaign. His portrayal in the manga is more brutal (he says they'll kill Tomoe after Kenshin's defeat).

Katsura Kogoro was the legendary young leader of the Chōshū Ishin-Shishi who, along with Ōkubo Toshimichi and Saigō Takamori, became one of the three key figures of the Meiji Restoration after they forged an alliance between former enemies Chōshū and Satsuma. After witnessing young Himura Kenshin's impressive performance in the Kiheitai, Katsura recruited the fourteen year-old swordsman into his service as a hitokiri in Kyoto and acts as the Battōsai's immediate superior during the Bakumatsu.

Affiliation: Yuuei
Quirk: One For All

He is the main protagonist of Boku no Hero Academia. Though originally born without a Quirk, he manages to catch the attention of the legendary hero All Might and has since become his close pupil and a student at UA.

Izuku is a very timid and polite boy. Due to being bullied since childhood for being born without a Quirk, he is initially portrayed as insecure, being more reserved and not self expressive, especially in front of Katsuki. However, after being accepted into UA and facing Katsuki during Battle Training, he has gradually become more confident and brave.

Izuku is also very diligent and strong willed. Since he greatly admires Heroes and has always aimed to be one, he has a habit of writing down in his notebooks all he knows about heroes and their quirks, including other UA students. He is a very caring person, and will never hesitate to rescue someone in danger, even if he knows he's not strong enough. When someone has a personal problem, Izuku will always try to help, even if it's not his business. Izuku also has the tendency to overthink with anything that grabs his attention, which makes him start mumbling to himself a lot.

All Might is the No.1 Hero and the ""Symbol of Peace."" He is famous for routinely saving the day with a smile on his face.

In his hero form, All Might is a very tall and muscular man whose design resembles classic American superhero comics. His whole body has more shadows than a normal human being.


However, in his true form, he appears to be grossly underweight. During an encounter with a villain five years ago, he suffered life-threatening injuries; the medical procedures that saved his life left him with an extremely frail physique. Now he can only serve as a hero for three hours a day, as his body cannot handle any more exertion.


All Might meets with All for One, the enemy who gave him his fatal wound, once more during the Hideout Raid arc. After a tough battle, All Might manages to defeat All For One, but ends up using all of his remaining power, ending his hero career once and for all.

Quirk: Zero Gravity

Ochako is Izuku's best friend. Her Quirk is Zero Gravity which allows her to make any object she touches with her fingertips float, although she will become nauseous if she uses the ability too much. Aside from Katsuki, she also refers to Izuku as ""Deku"" but unlike the former, she calls him this nickname out of affection, commenting that ""Deku"" gives the vibe of never giving up. She eventually switches to Deku-kun a move that prompted him to accept the name. She comes from a family of construction workers, and because there is not much of a market for them, they are poor. Due to this, Ochako aspires to become a hero for money so she can give her parents an easy life. Ochako originally meets Izuku prior to Yuuei's entrance exam, after she stops him from falling over after he tripped on his own foot. This caused Izuku to develop a large crush on her (as he had ""talked"" to a girl), to the point of blushing and stammering every time he is with her. Izuku eventually returns the favor by saving her during the entrance exam, and Yuuga later deduces that Ochako returns Izuku's feelings, despite her attempts to deny this.

Quirk: Erasure

The homeroom teacher for class 1-A. He always looks extremely tired but hates to waste time. He is a Hero known as Eraserhead whose Quirk Erasure is to nullify others' Quirks so long as they remain in his line of sight. If he blinks, his Quirk deactivates, so he always wears goggles to prevent enemies from figuring out whose quirk he is nullifying, effectively creating confusion. Continued use of his Quirk gives him dry eye, which makes him unable to use it for some time after.

He is a person moved primarily by logic, as he tries not to fuss about his appearance. He tends to be blunt and rather flatlined when it comes to his ideals and explanations about things. When he has a particular belief, he will state it without holding anything back. He often comes off as cold and apathetic, showing very little energy and sometimes letting his own students resolve certain issues by themselves.

In spite of his apathetic traits, Shota does seem to genuinely care about his students, and will go to great lengths to protect them from danger. He did not hesitate to react to the Villains presence both at the USJ, and at the Field Trip lodge. He also has expressed his belief in his students on multiple occasions

Hitagi, the main female character of

When she was in the first year of high school, she encountered a mysterious crab, after which she became nearly weightless. Ever since then, she has avoided contact with everyone else, threatening everyone who discovers her secret. She called herself a tsundere and always speaks in an abusive style.


At the end of Mayoi Snail, she admits that she loves Koyomi, and subsequently enters into a relationship with him. After the events in Tsukihi Phoenix, she overcomes all of her trauma, and becomes a rather cheerful and normal girl. She starts calling Araragi with a cute nickname, chuckling at small things and sending e-mails full of emoticons, although her sharp tongue is still there, but toned down. She also seems to have a father complex as she becomes excited to the point of being unable to fall asleep when using her father's blanket."

She appears to be an eight-year-old girl, but she was originally a beautiful vampire who had lived for more than 500 years. At the end of events of Koyomi Vamp, after Koyomi realizes that having saved his master from a certain death, leaded to a future where she will kill humans (the ""portable food"" she calls them) to ensure her survival, Koyomi revolts against Kissshot in a bloody battle to death, where Kissshot chooses not to use her full powers (in order to have a proper battle with her servant). Later on the battle it is revealed that she pretended to turn Koyomi into a human again, by letting herself be killed by Koyomi. After the shocking revelation, he cannot bring himself to kill his master who was giving her life for his, and who cared for him at the point of risking her life to save his (from sunburn) at the beginning of Spring's Break. But to prevent herself from eating more humans, Koyomi asked for help to Oshino Meme, who in the end tells that as a happy ending won't be possible for everyone, then everyone will have an unhappy ending! While Koyomi himself cannot return to be a fully human, Kissshot Acerolaorion Heartunderblade was left in a weakened condition (where she is no longer able to eat humans, and needs her servant's blood to survive) with no powers or traces of her original personality and therefore have to abandon her ""Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade"" (キスショット・アセロラオリオン・ハートアンダーブレード) name. Ever since ""Tsubasa Cat"" where she starts living in Araragi's shadow, she no longer needs to suck his blood on a regular basis in order to stay alive. She forms a physical connection with Araragi where they can feel each others emotions and senses. It is also later revealed that she can gain strength into an ""evolved"" form after sucking Araragi's blood more than the usual dosage, she does this in order to fight for Araragi when he confronts Yotsugi and Yozuru. In Mayoi Jiangshi, in the alternate timeline, Shinobu went berserk when Koyomi was killed by Black Hanekawa, feeling that she was somewhat responsible for his death, so she swore to destroy the world and created the Jiangshi that has been swarming the town. It seems that she truly cares about Koyomi and when she saw Koyomi was alive in the alternate timeline, she started weeping blood. In the end, Araragi simply states that he will die together with Shinobu. Her father named her Lola, however she went by the name Acerola.

Koyomi Araragi is a third year high school student who survived a vampire attack during spring break and barely regained his human life in the time that followed as a boy with remnants of vampiric traits. He can see in the dark, his eyes turn red when he gets angry, and he heals incredibly fast. As a result, he questions his lifespan. He remains scared of morning sunlight despite the fact that it no longer has any negative effects on him.

Koyomi is a laid-back person whose only real friend at school is Tsubasa Hanekawa. He's a poor student, close to failing every class except math.

It is revealed through conversations that he's quite knowledgeable with anime; a fact even noted by Nadeko Sengoku once.

Although he is shown to be attracted to the other girls, he turns their advances down due to his loyalty to Hitagi.

Other characters seems to speculate that Koyomi is a lolicon, particularly Mayoi and Hitagi, with Hitagi thinking that Nadeko is a ""threat"" to her.

He is very noble, which is why Hitagi is attracted to him. He is willing to help others at the cost of his own life. As such, the female characters he has helped are quite attached to him. He feels most comfortable talking to Mayoi, Shinobu and, from the Second Season on, to Yotsugi about his problems.

Koyomi is the only person who thinks that his family relationship is bad, with Karen and Tsukihi thinking otherwise. His parents were revealed to be police officers.

His personality is portrayed more clearly in the novels, where his inner thoughts show him to be much more perverted and intelligent than the anime leads one to believe.

Due to events prior to
Kizumonogatari
and
Bakemonogatari
, Koyomi avoided having friends and seemed to have lost faith and trust in people and himself.

Kaiki, Deishuu;Deishuu Kaiki (貝木 泥舟);"Deishuu ""Suzuki"" Kaiki";"
Kaiki Deishuu is a conman specializing in fake apparitions.

Kaiki has a gloomy personality and subscribes to the view that there is nothing in the world that is inherently true. The only absolute in life for him is money, due to its value in providing anything he wants that isn't irreplaceable; he even believes it can readily buy concepts like love and happiness. An adept schemer, Kaiki has an opaque mind to outsiders. He is fluent in the arts of lying and subterfuge, so the reasoning behind what he says is constantly blurred. He explains his name as ""Kai,"" like a mound of clam shells, and ""Ki,"" like a dead tree.

Kaiki is an individual who prides himself in having no pride. He openly admits to being a conman and an impostor, among other things, but often this is to his advantage as a master of wordplay. He flows easily in his interactions with others, and he is willing to give and take in order to maximize profit or cut his losses as needed.

Kaiki is a fake specialist who knows about paranormal creatures, but does not personally believe in them. Instead, he manipulates those who do believe, using his knowledge to make money off of them.


In ""Nisemonogatari"" he serves as the main antagonist of the ""Karen Bee"" arc. He is identified as the one who swindled the Senjougahara family, as well as the one distributing charms among junior students of Naoetsu High School throughout ""Bakemonogatari"" and ""Nisemonogatari."" Confronted by Karen Araragi for his actions, Kaiki uses a bee apparition to incapacitate her and leaves. He is confronted in the arc's finale by Araragi Koyomi and Senjougahara Hitagi, who demand he cure Karen's curse and leave town for good. Kaiki claims that the bee apparition was a fake, a simple trick of hypnosis, and that whatever symptoms she is suffering will pass in a matter of days. He then agrees to their demands and decides to leave the town for good, though not before some choice words to Senjougahara. It is later revealed in the ""Tsukihi Phoenix"" arc that he was a colleague of Kagenui Yozuru and Oshino Meme during their days in university, having supplied the former information regarding Araragi Tsukihi.

In ""Monogatari Series: Second Season,"" he serves as the narrator and main protagonist in ""Koimonogatari."" He is hired in secret by Senjougahara to deceive the human-turned-snake god, Sengoku Nadeko, who had vowed to kill Araragi and his loved ones. Despite being prompted by Gaen Izuko to back out, Kaiki persists and narrowly succeeds in convincing Nadeko to give up her godhood and attachment to Araragi by appealing to her (well-hidden) former dream of becoming a mangaka. During the arc's resolution, just as he is about to leave town he is attacked by one of the junior high students that he scammed in ""Nisemonogatari,"" evidently tipped off by Oshino Ougi and implied to be the same student that had previously cursed Nadeko with a snake apparition.

Having survived the attack, Kaiki meets with Kanbaru Suruga during the events of ""Hanamonogatari,"" where he reveals that the ""woman of his dreams"" was Kanbaru's mother, Gaen Tooe. Gaen entrusted Kaiki with Suruga's well-being before she died; in honor of this promise, Kanbaru is the only one whom Kaiki shows unconditional kindness and never attempts to swindle. He offers Kanbaru his card—with the usual ""ghost buster"" moniker scratched off—and tells her to call him if she's ever in need. Not long afterward he sends her the mummified devil's head, which he claims was given to him by Gaen."

She is always seen dressed in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, even outside of school days, and is rarely seen on any other type of clothing, except for a set of sleepwear which she wore during Tsubasa Cat Arc.

Hanekawa Tsubasa is Araragi's classmate and the class president. Araragi describes her as ""the class president of all class presidents."" The reason Tsubasa and Hitagi cut their hair short is because they learned Araragi likes it short.

Hanekawa currently lives with her stepfather and stepmother.


Hanekawa Family's Past:

Her biological mother was 17 years old when she got pregnant, the biological father is unknown because she apparently had many lovers. Before she gave birth to Tsubasa, she married another man who was a ""workaholic."" Right after giving birth, Tsubasa's biological mother commited suicide. The workaholic stepfather, unable to raise a child, remarried again to a woman who is Tsubasa's current mother. The workaholic father soon died from overwork and the current mother married another man who is now Tsubasa's current father.

Hanekawa Story's overview in Nekomonogatari/Bakemonogatari:

Prior to the beginning of Bakemonogatari Hanekawa was possessed by a bakeneko (mischievous spirit of a dead cat) during Golden Week due to stress over her family (see Nekomonogatari: Kuro). The matter was eventually resolved with the help of Shinobu at the cost of some of Hanekawa's memories, but the problem emerged again right before the school festival because of different stress. Araragi was told by Hanekawa's bakeneko form that she has feelings for him. In ""Tsubasa Tiger"" (Nekomonogatari: Shiro), on her way to school, she met a tiger spirit which spoke to her. Soon buildings important to Hanekawa began to mysteriously burn down and ""Black Hanekawa"" (her bakeneko form) began to take over her body every time she slept. The inevitable showdown was afoot and led to some surprising events. ""Tsubasa Tiger"" is written from the perspective of Hanekawa rather than Araragi."

Befitting her age, Mayoi is cheerful, energetic and inquisitive. She makes a lot of spelling mistakes and has a habit of mispronouncing Koyomi's family name. On the other hand, she does not easily trust strangers, and will even fight back against them if they become too nosy.


Ten years ago she was involved in a traffic accident and died because of it. After that she became a ghost and considers herself a ""lost snail"". She unwillingly causes the people around her to become lost and unable to find their way home. The only people who can see her are people who don't want to go home in the first place. However, after Araragi and Senjougahara help her find the home she was looking for, she changed from an ""earthbound spirit"" to a ""wandering spirit"", a fact that she considers to be a bonus, as well as granting her to be free to wander wherever she desires. At the end of Nisemonogatari, she said goodbye to Koyomi, implying that she will not be seeing him again, which will be the basis of the next story, Mayoi Jiangshi. Her family name before her parents got divorced was Tsunade.

In Shinobu Time, she is chased by the darkness together with Koyomi Araragi. It is later revealed by Izuko Gaen that the darkness was targeting Hachikuji because she remained in the town even after she was saved by Koyomi. To stop the darkness, she finally decides that she must pass on. She kisses Koyomi and confesses her love for him before she vanishes."

She's quite protective of her hair (particularly her forelocks) thinking that it's her place to guard more than her panties. When she finally combed her forelocks aside in Nisemonogatari, Koyomi commented that she has a glare just like a serpent, probably foreshadowing the story of Nadeko Medusa.

During Halloween, Nadeko met a girl named Ougi who gave her a white scrunchie. After, she was able to see a white serpent, Kuchinawa, in the place of it. In Nadeko's class, the atmosphere has become strained and because Nadeko is the class rep, she's been pressured to do something about it. Later on, Kuchinawa tells her to go to the shrine where she last sacrificed snakes in Bakemonogatari. He commands her to atone for what she did by finding the remains of the snake god that inhabited the shrine in the past. She tries not to involve Koyomi, but he manages to find her at night and takes her to his house. She wakes up next to Tsukihi and manages to bring up the topic of Koyomi's girlfriend. Finally, Nadeko reveals her jealousy toward Hitagi, but claims that she would never try to steal him. Tsukihi says that she planned to support her if Nadeko was going to do so. However, since Nadeko instead said she doesn't want to trouble him, Tsukihi says it's as if after all these years passed, that Nadeko is using her brother as in excuse to reject boys from her school. Tsukihi loses her patience and suddenly cuts Nadeko's fringe. This way, she wouldn't be able to hide her face or emotions anymore, which she later attempts again with her teacher. Yet without her fringe, he can see that she isn't disturbed at all. Nadeko ended up very ""uncharistically"" snapping at him and after, to her classmates. The serpent then tells Nadeko that its remains are in Araragi's house, where she finds the paper charm Gaen previously trusted Koyomi with. Kuchinawa offers to grant Nadeko any wish, and she already knows what to ask for: Koyomi to love her back. She says this in front of him, but he says that her desire cannot be granted. After some of Shinobu's provocation, Nadeko eats the charm and becomes an oddity, sharing her body with Kuchinawa, and her hair turns white with each lock becoming a snake. As an oddity, Nadeko reveals her true colors: an obsessive, egotistical, cynical girl, who would not hesitate to kill in order to keep her delusional and impossible love story."
Kanbaru, Suruga;Suruga Kanbaru (神原 駿河);Suruga  Kanbaru;"
Suruga, the main character of Suruga Monkey, is Koyomi's underclassman, star of the school's basketball team and one of Hitagi's acquaintances from back in junior high school. She is so well known in her school that not a single student had not heard of her, mostly because it was her who was responsible of the rapid rise of success of the school's girls basketball team due to her talents. She considers herself a lesbian, fujoshi, lolicon and masochist. Her hobbies include reading yaoi literature and playing basketball. Although her sexual preference is clearly towards females, she does not have a hard time interacting with males, and she even manages to say teasing remarks when she is comfortable with the person she talks to (i.e. Araragi). She is 160cm tall.

Suruga is a girl with brown eyes and dark bluish hair. Because of her club activities as a basketball varsity player, she boasts an athletic physique, although she admits that her breasts might not be ample enough for Araragi to notice.

Her clothing style reflects her boyish personality; when she is not in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, she often wears sleeveless clothing and shorts. Whichever clothes she wears, she is regularly seen wearing cycling shorts, which she considers to be her underwear, much to Araragi's shock upon hearing it straight from her (as it implies that she does not wear panties).


Hidden from others, however, is her tendency to be jealous of others to the point of thinking of causing bodily harm to them for revenge. This would eventually fuel her killing intent as the Rainy Devil. Back in elementary school, she inherited what she thought was a monkey's paw. At this time, she had been teased at for being slow in track. Because of this, Suruga decides to use the monkey's paw to grant her wish to become the fastest among her classmates. Unexpectedly, her competitors in one race she would participate in were attacked by an unknown assailant and were absent the next day. This would soon continue for some time, and this caused Suruga to be afraid, especially upon her discovery of the novel The Monkey's Paw, which tells the story of a similar item that grants wishes for a certain price. Suruga would soon shift her focus to basketball, where she immediately shone as the school's ace player, and this caused Hitagi Senjougahara, the track ace at that time, to take notice of her talent. She and Hitagi become close friends,with Kanbaru calling their pairing the Valhalla Combo (ヴァルハラコンビ Varuhara Konbi, formed by the ""varu"" from Kanbaru and ""hara"" from Senjougahara), and she soon forgot about the monkey's paw. Immediately after she entered senior high school, she became aware of Hitagi's secret and was threatened by her, just like Koyomi was. However, unlike the persistent Araragi, Kanbaru followed Hitagi's advice and stopped talking to Hitagi since that time. However, she then started stalking Koyomi after she discovered he was dating Hitagi. In Suruga Devil, there seems to be a rumor about a devil solving other people's problem. Fearing that she might be the rumored ""Devil,"" she decided to investigate and found out that the rumored Devil is actually an old basketball rival of hers named, Numachi Rouka. It seems that Kanbaru is still worried about the effects of the Rainy Devil after it has been dispersed to the point that whenever she goes to sleep, she would bind her devil's arm to a pillar so that she wouldn't start sleepwalking and committing crimes and check the newspaper everyday so that she can make sure she didn't do anything unconsciously. She also has dreams of her mother once in a while which give her weird life lessons. She is named Kanbaru Suruga now but she was previously named Gaen Suruga. Izuko is her aunt and Suruga's mother had some kind of connection to oddities as she had inherited that devil's left arm from her mother. Her mother and father were revealed to have eloped as the Kanbaru family did not agree with their relationship. Kanbaru is also the only person that Kaiki will ever treat in a good way.

Oshino, Meme;Meme Oshino (忍野 メメ);Meme  Oshino;"
Meme is a middle-aged man who lives in an abandoned building. Being an expert in apparitions field, he solves Koyomi and others' problems. Although he sometimes expects compensation, he does not require it always and seems to help those in need from good nature. Due to his vast knowledge of supernatural studies and general oddities, he serves as Araragi's informant during his stay in the city.

Oshino is a graduate of Shinto studies in college, although he never pursued the career of being a Shinto priest. Despite that, he is perfectly capable to accomplish spiritual works of a Shinto priest, such as exorcising entities and solving paranormal mysteries. He occasionally wears a Priest's outfit, as seen with the session with Senjougahara and the heavy crab. Meme's other notable accessories include an earring on his right ear and a necklace, both consisting of an inverted cross."
Oshino, Ougi;Ougi Oshino (忍野 扇);Ougi  Oshino;"
Ougi appears as a girl with short black hair, black pupils, and pale white skin and is a junior of Koyomi Araragi at Naoetsu Private High School, as Ougi refers to Koyomi as senpai. Ougi claims to be Meme Oshino's niece.

In Hanamonogatari and Orokamonogatari, Ougi appears as a male.


At the start of Kabukimonogatari, Ougi is seen having a trivial conversation with Koyomi about traffic lights, causing him to think about Mayoi Hachikuji. When Ougi meets Nadeko at the beginning of Otorimonogatari, initially appearing to merely want to tell Nadeko to stop playing the victim, it is later revealed that Ougi is the mastermind behind tricking Nadeko into becoming a snake god. Four months after Mayoi disappears, Koyomi has a conversation with Ougi in the classroom. After that, Ougi leaves by saying there is a lot of work to do. When Koyomi asks about the job, Ougi tells him it's basically work that involves punishing liars. Koyomi encounters Ougi on his way to North Shirahebi Shrine, who then states that they had been waiting there for him since morning to offer him some words of encouragement. When Koyomi says he doesn't regret turning into a vampire, they tell him that the reason they like him is because he is easy to twist around. As Koyomi walks off towards the mountain, Ougi tells him that at the cost of losing many things, he has matured. Gaen reveals that Ougi’s true identity is Araragi Koyomi himself. She is an Oddity that Araragi created, similarly to how Hanekawa’s stress created Black Hanekawa, and Sengoku’s hallucinations created the white snake Kuchinawa. Ougi represents Araragi’s self-criticism. When Araragi saw ""Darkness"" for the first time in Shinobu Time, he realized that there is a law dictating over the world of Oddity. Araragi knows that he is too weak, too hesitant, too emotional to make harsh decisions, and he subconsciously wished for a being that can judge him, and ""correct"" everything wrong in this world. His desire came true as Oshino Ougi. In Suruga Bonhead, it is implied that male and female Ougi might be different identities or are the same oddity but reshaped depended on who the ""target"" is. Male Ougi appears to ""help"" Suruga but also still works with Araragi as his helping hand."
Ginko;Ginko  (ギンコ);"Ginko ""Mushishi, Yoki"" ";"
Ginko employs himself as a Mushi master (mushishi), traveling from place to place to research Mushi and aid people suffering from problems caused by them.

Ginko is a rare person who attracts mushi. This inspires his peripatetic lifestyle; staying in one place too long will gather a potentially dangerous amount of mushi. He also smokes constantly in order to keep mushi away.

In terms of personality, Ginko is rather laid back, but can be very serious when it comes to protecting people from mushi. He also often stresses that the mushi are not evil, but they merely exist as a part of the nature and try to survive like every other living being.


When Nui found him, he was unconscious in the woods, wounded and abandoned. As he had no place to go, Nui decided to care for him instead of making him leave. He went by the name ""Yoki"" until Nui was consumed by the Ginko mushi. Yoki lost his memory and was forced to take a new name because of the nature of the Ginko mushi, thus changing his name in the only thing he remembers, ""Ginko""

Ginko's unusual white hair and green eye color is the result of an incident involving a mushi that occurred when he was a child.

He lost his other eye and hair color when he tried to save Nui from the Ginko mushi that lived in the pond near where they lived. Nui protected Ginko by telling him to offer them as a sacrifice so the Ginko would let him be. He never saw Nui again and after nearly being consumed by the mushi he adopted the name Ginko to save himself."

Dola, Schwi;Schwi Dola (シュヴィ・ドーラ);"Schwi ""Shuvi, Üc207Pr4f57t9"" Dola";"
Schwi was the first Exmachina to be introduced in Tet's story. In the story she seeks to understand the human heart and was found by Riku. She looks like a young human but with several differences, being two tails coming out from her back and other machine like features protruding from around her body. She bears many similarities with Shiro.

Her behavior is similar to that of a stereotypical artificial intelligence. She can absorb and process data and intelligence very quickly and act in the appropriate manner, a unique characteristic of her race. However, she seems to have difficulty in comprehending emotions and desires, otherwise characterized by her as the heart.


After setting her personality to mimic that of a ""shy Imanity survivor"" and spending a year around Riku's colony, she is unable to reset her personality back to the default monotonous mannerisms of the Machina, stating that she is ""stuck"" in that mode. Over time spent with Riku, she seems to have started to develop her own heart. She eventually marries him.

The Exmachina are a hive mind unit, however Schwi was excommunicated from the unit due to various system and logic errors. Therefore, Schwi is unable to access all 27451 of the artificial weapons stored in the Exmachinas' linked arsenal.

Schwi is killed at the end of the Great War by Jibril's full-powered attack, leaving nothing of her body behind other than a ring.

Dola, Riku;Riku Dola (リク・ドーラ);Riku  Dola;"
Riku was an 18 years old Imanity who lived during the Great War on Disboard. He was one of the main protagonists in Tet's story. He encountered Shuvi while going on an expedition and brought her to his colony after having lost in a game against her (albeit willingly).

He bears many similarities with Sora, being his black hair, slender body, black eyes and his face. Riku is a master strategist and manipulator, much like Sora. He is capable of duping even the matriarch of the Nilvalen family (known as the strongest and smartest Elf at the time) into giving out valuable information, albeit at the cost of his health.


Ever since his home was destroyed and he took over as leader of his colony, he's had a somewhat split personality. When the figurative lock on his heart is locked, he appears emotionless, cold, and calculating. When his heart is unlocked, the emotions he bottled up are released (often violently). His endeavors with Shuvi has since lessened his split personality and he appears to be more open around her. He eventually marries Shuvi.

Through his efforts and skillful leadership, the Imanity were able to manipulate all the races into forming alliances with each other and drastically change the tide of the Great War, all while standing in the sidelines. It is implied that Riku is the first ever living being on the world of Disboard to create the concept of ""cheating without getting caught."" He is also the one responsible for the allocation of the 16 Race Pieces.

He led 177 fellow Imanity during the Great War against the Phantoms, which eventually caused the war to end, but with the sacrifice of both of his hands, left eye, all his skin being burnt, and organs damaged which led to his death.

Eyes: red

Abandoned by his parents, Sora is a brilliant NEET hikikomori gamer along with his stepsister, Shiro. He does not take life very seriously and is pretty much a good-for-nothing gamer. One day, he and his sister are called into an alternate world.

Sora is tall and thin with spiky brown hair, and constantly wears a sly grin on his face. Despite being a NEET and a shut in, Sora is extremely outgoing and confident, and is not afraid to play games with people face-to-face, even when they are cheating. He is also extremely manipulative, which he refers to as using negotiating skills. This fits in with his play style. While Shiro is excellent at logic and computing, Sora can read people and predict what their next move is, using this knowledge to beat them.

However, if he is separated from Shiro by so much as a closed door, he becomes a spineless, cowardly wreck, and only returns to his former self if he is able to see her. He views his sister as his equal and partner, but is also protective of her, shown by actions such as putting his body between her and the ground when he thought they were going to hit hard when first arriving on Disboard.

Sora is extroverted and has no problems dealing with people. While not as intelligent as Shiro, he is shown to have a brilliant IQ. Rather than computing numbers like Shiro, Sora can rapidly compute what his opponents are going to do based on observing their behavior and motivations. He is also slightly perverted and desires a girlfriend for himself. His lust leads to a linguistic mistake that causes Stephanie to fall in love with him and causes him to receive a scolding from Shiro.

She also rarely shows much emotion at all on her face and, despite her genius intellect, speaks in short terse sentences. Shiro is extremely close to her brother, to the point of needing him by her side at all times to be comfortable. She is also shown to have a dry and somewhat twisted sense of humor, and displays signs of jealousy if Sora pays serious attention to other girls, showing she has a brother complex.

She is against the book sharing law created by the Council of Eighteen Wings and left Avant Heim, her homeland, to win the National Library of Elchea from the previous king in a game. When Sora heard what happened to the library, he challenged Jibril in order to gain knowledge of the other kingdoms. When she lost the game, she became Sora and Shiro's servant since she had bet everything she owned, including herself, claiming that knowledge was worth her own life. However, she was allowed to keep the library and maintain it although she now must share it with the rest of Imanity. Jibril thus took the siblings as her masters and over time she began to understand and accept Sora's belief in the potential of humans.

According to Azriel, Jibril was given the gift of imperfection by Artosh. This gift is what Artosh believed would allow Jibril to find the answer to the Flügels' continued existence should he disappear (which was, in fact, the case).

It was confirmed by Teto after stated by Sora that he dragged him and Shiro into his world due to the frustration of losing a chess game against 'blank.' He brought them so they could play against each other once more. This implies that Teto believes that Sora will most-likely conquer the world.

Long ago, there was a mushi unlike any other, a forbidden mushi that destroyed all things indiscriminately. But a mushishi of the Karibusa family sealed this forbidden mushi inside herself, turning her skin the color of ink and eventually killing her. But not before she had a child.

Since then, one in every other generation of the Karibusa family has carried the forbidden mushi inside them, rendering part of their bodies ink black and useless. But they have learned how to bind it. By listening to stories of the death of other mushi, they can subdue the forbidden mushi and use its mark like ink to write these stories down and seal the forbidden mushi away on paper. Those who do this are the Recorders. They live in an isolated house with their records, visited only by the family and mushishi.

Karibusa Tanyuu is the fourth Recorder. The curse is located on her right leg, and she has learned to be skillful at moving on crutches and hopping on one foot. And in spite of the pain that this forbidden mushi constantly causes her, she loves and respects mushi, all forms of life.

Age: 15-16
Birthday: July 1 (Cancer)
Height: 167 cm
Blood Type: B

Natsume Takashi is the main protagonist of the series who, like his deceased grandmother Natsume Reiko, has the ability to see ayakashi (spirits). He inherited the Book of Friends from her, a book of contracts binding ayakashi to servitude when they were defeated by Reiko. Due to Natsume's strong resemblance to his grandmother, he is often mistaken for her and is pursued by ayakashi who hate Reiko but yearn for the Book of Friends. To rid himself of these troubles, Natsume resolved to end the book by returning all the contracted names to their former owners. He is accompanied by the youkai Madara, nicknamed ""Nyanko-sensei"" (or simply ""sensei""), promising him possession of the book once he dies. In return, the creature must serve as his bodyguard until then.

Orphaned at an early age, Natsume was passed on from relative to relative. His ability to see and communicate with ayakashi isolated him from both family and friends throughout his childhood. He was labeled as a 'liar' and 'attention seeker' for trying to tell others about the ayakashi, and his attempts to run away from the youkai had them calling him insane. Natsume then became reclusive in order to try to lead a relatively “normal” life with people. Eventually, he was passed on to the Fujiwaras, a middle-aged couple from his father's side of the family. In contrast to the relatives before, they genuinely care for Natsume, and he loves them in return. He does not want to cause them any trouble, so the ayakashi problem remains secret.

Natsume's incredibly strong spiritual power allows him to actually hit and hurt youkai. He develops friendships with youkai and exorcists alike, though the interest of many is to use him to their advantage. In the anime, Natsume is more cheery and good-natured, while in the manga, he is slightly more dismal and short-tempered, especially toward Nyanko-sensei.

To return the names inscribed in the Book of Friends, Natsume must first picture the said ayakashi in his mind to learn of its name. The book then flips open to the page where the name is written, which he takes out and places in his mouth while breathing out. The spell which originally enslaved the spirits used Reiko's saliva and breath; as Reiko's grandson and one who bears a strong resemblance to Reiko, Natsume is able to use the spell as well. The cost of releasing each name, however, is that his energy is almost completely drained in the process."
Madara;Madara  (斑);"Madara ""Sensei, Nyanko, Nyangoro, Nyankichi, Ponta, Nyanta, Nyan-Nyan"" ";"
Madara was sealed in a shrine until he was accidentally released by Natsume. Because Madara was trapped in a material form for so long, Madara ordinary takes on the shape of a maneki neko (lucky cat), leading Natsume to nickname him Nyanko-sensei. In this form, other people can see him, leading for Natsume having to ask his guardians if he could keep him as a pet.

Madara is a powerful spirit, who protects Natsume from others and teaches him spells on occasion, in return for Natsume's promise to give him the Book of Friends when he dies. They often fight each other, which leads to Natsume punching Madara on the face and knocking him out. Despite his protests of not being a cat, he likes to play with cat toys. Nyanko's design is based on a lucky cat statue Midorikawa was given as a child. In the anime, Natsume is more respectful to Madara."
Natsume, Reiko;Reiko Natsume (夏目 レイコ);Reiko  Natsume;"
Takashi Natsume's grandmother, from whom he inherited the ability to see yokai. Reiko had high spiritual energy, which gave her the ability to see and seal yokai.

Reiko was always shunned and even got rocks thrown at her for being able to see yokai. That is why she created the Book of Friends, Reiko was lonely and wanted friends. Since she believed no human could ever understand her, she turned to the spirits for companionship. Reiko was extraordinarily powerful, and so she bullied spirits into obeying her by playing games with them. If they lost, she would make them give her their names. Reiko gathered the names into the Book of Friends, this gave her the ability to summon whichever yokai she had the name of. A necessary part of the sealing was her saliva and breath. Madara mentions that she had sloppy table manners and was very forgetful.

Reiko died when she was young, so no one remembered her."

Tohru Taki is a female student at Natsume's school. She was first ""discovered"" by one of Natsume's friends, Nishimura who had heard rumors of her beauty and became entranced, he still maintains an obvious crush on her even though Natsume holds most of her attention.

Taki is introduced into the story as a shy, silent girl. Later, the reason for this is because she was cursed by a yokai; the last 13 names said by her will be eaten by him at the end of a one year period. The yokai also throws her into an impossible gamble for her life which he does not honor even when she wins.

Taki is generally a happy, extroverted and optimistic girl. She is shown to have a peculiar taste in cuteness, as is shown when she hugs Nyanko-sensei, calling him cute. Like Tanuma, she tries to help Natsume in any way she can, but is usually prevented from doing so because Natsume worries about their involvement with yokai.

Even though Taki herself has too little spirit energy to see yokai, she does have the knowledge of drawing yokai circles, discovered by her grandfather. The circle, once drawn, gives any human the ability to see yokai who step within the radius of the circle. The circle does not require any spirit energy to create and activate, so anyone could possible draw it if they know how to. But due to it being complicated in looks, Taki is presummably the only one able to draw it without the need of a guide."

Onizuka, Eikichi;Eikichi Onizuka (鬼塚 英吉);Eikichi  Onizuka;"
Birthday: August 3, 1975

A 22-year-old, hormonal, blonde-haired biker and virgin, Onizuka Eikichi graduated from a bottom-rung university by cheating and, as such, cannot get a decent job. His main way of spending time is peering up girls' skirts in a local mall. He is very athletic, as he can bench press 150 kg (331 lbs), has a second dan black belt in karate, and even claims to perform 500 push-ups, 1000 pull ups and 2000 squats daily.

Through the events explained in the Great Teacher Onizuka manga, Onizuka decides to become a teacher, even though it is later implied that he has an IQ of about 50 (Though not necessarily true). His initial teacher training is in the Musashino Public High School, where he meets Nanako Mizuki. His experience taming the rowdy gangs in his assigned class hardens his convictions that teaching is the way to go, and when he learns of Mizuki's problems, he also decides to abstain from sexual experience with his students, opting to solve their personal issues for them, instead.

Unfortunately, he nearly messes up by forgetting to take the public teachers' civil service exam. As a result, no public high school will take him, but he is still eligible for a number of private schools. He manages to get a job at the upper-crust Holy Forest Academy, despite the objections of vice-principal Uchiyamada Hiroshi, whom he continues to aggravate well into his tenure. Of course, one of the conditions of having the job at Holy Forest is that he must sleep at the school—in the storage room at the top floor, with roof access—and it is here that Onizuka officially starts his career in teaching, when he stops Yoshikawa Noboru from committing suicide.

Onizuka is put in charge of class 3-4, a class so bad it has already driven several teachers insane. Not only does he survive the class's brutal bullying tactics, but he also befriends his students, and the backbone to the story of Great Teacher Onizuka consists of his unique experiences in turning his students around and learning lessons of his own.

It is later implied again, during the National Exams, that Onizuka might actually be some sort of genius. His exam results were swapped: once for full marks, and once for just short of full marks. However, when Yoshito Kikuchi is asked whether he is curious about Onizuka's true results, he checks the answers himself and the result amazes him. He checks with Onizuka, who states that he definitely got perfect results from his own effort (which would be incredible, since he did a 5 hour exam in 1 hour, bleeding, and having 4 bullets in his stomach).

Onizuka has incredible physical resilience. On more than one occasion, he has fallen from heights that would instantly kill most people and claims to have a sort of healing factor, as he healed from a broken arm in less than a day, and even endure multiple gunshot wounds, in a short period of time. Onizuka often presents his strength in unintentionally flamboyant ways, such as arm wrestling over 100 men of exponential strength in a row and winning (including the character Heihachi from the Tekken series of fighting games, and Jason Voorhees from the films called Friday the 13th (series)). His fighting abilities are not to be taken lightly either, as Onizuka is capable of fending off multiple opponents, even if they are well-armed, and almost never receives any physical damage.

In spite of his impressive fighting skills, Onizuka is often roughed up by his students, and others, whenever he behaves badly. It could be speculated that deep down, Onizuka knows when he's acting immature, and allows others to keep him in line. An example of this is when he forces his students to dig the earth for buried treasure during the Okinawa trip. Kanzaki Urumi kicks Onizuka into a hole, and later forces him to wear S&M garb and has him crawl around on all fours, with Urumi riding on his back. Yet another example is when Principal Uchiyamada has Onizuka over for dinner and hits him upside the head with a wooden bench after finding out that Onizuka was acting a bit of a letch with his daughter one day (Onizuka was playing ""where's the nipple"" with his daughter, at a karaoke bar in town).

His personal mode of transportation is a Kawasaki Z2 motorcycle 750cc type S. The bike itself is also featured heavily in the prequel series to GTO."
Kanzaki, Urumi;Urumi Kanzaki (神崎麗美);Urumi  Kanzaki;"
The antithesis to the ""dumb blonde"" stereotype, Urumi Kanzaki is a prodigy with an IQ over 200. She is also a heterochromatic, possessing different colored eyes: one brown and one blue. However, she is psychologically disturbed, having her fair share of hate toward teachers. Her genius is displayed repeatedly by such abstract actions as the detonation of time bombs (i.e. firecrackers in disposable boxes) and making a harmless snake look like a cobra using paper cutouts. Her intellect is also shown through actions, such as shouting curse words in French and being able to speak fluent Mandarin. On the trip in Okinawa, Toshito Kikuchi noted that she can speak 5 languages, but ironically, she doesn't understand what her Gundam otaku roommates say.


Her hatred for teachers stems from her time in elementary school. Urumi's teacher, Ms. Fujimori, while initially welcoming and receptive, wasn't able to handle her intellect properly, since she went to a second-rate college, and it was her first year teaching. Urumi's constant requests for the teacher's time, both inside and outside of school, as well as the fact that the lessons she wanted to learn from the teacher included extremely advanced, college-level subjects (such as differential calculus) eventually made the teacher snap. When Urumi interrupted Ms. Fujimori's lecture to correct her in front of the whole class, the teacher then told Urumi's secret to her class. While it isn't stated explicitly, it can be deduced that her intelligence is derived from her biological father, when Urumi tells Eikichi Onizuka that her mother had selected a sperm-donor, based on his intellect and nothing more. It is even suggested that her mother took the sperm from an American scientific genius (this information can be gleaned from a scene where Urumi and her mother visited some friends in the United States, and Urumi was led into a dark storage room by a doctor, who explains to her that her father is actually just a bottle of donated sperm); this also explains Urumi's natural, blond hair. Naturally, this caused a great deal of psychological trauma to Urumi, and quite an understandable hatred of teachers. It is still unclear what happened to Ms. Fujimori, as her last appearance in the storyline was begging Onizuka to help Urumi before something terrible happens to her. She is later found by Miyabi in a small apartment, and hired to torture Onizuka. Formerly a student at Holy Forest for a while, but stopped attending regularly after some time, she begins almost immediately, as she frames him for lechery and sends him to jail overnight, only to appear in class and on his homeroom roster the morning after. Onizuka's frustration with her vastly increases, when Vice-Principal Uchiyamada strictly advises him that he cannot inflict physical harm on her due, to her educational potential. Urumi is eventually able to turn Onizuka into her slave (more-or-less, her ""genie"") by threatening to have him arrested, after she fakes her death when he accidentally pushes her off a building. However, all this changes when she encounters her Ms. Fujimori again, awakening her deepest hatred and causing her to direct her wrath at the student body. Onizuka responds by bringing his biker gang to school and ""kidnaps"" her from class. He is finally able to get through to her by almost killing the two of them by jumping over - and nearly falling into - a gap at a suspension bridge, despite her attempts to convince him that she is not afraid of anything, including death. Onizuka makes her see past her trauma, however bad, just isn't worth messing up the present with (in the manga, he does this by having his biker friends share their life experiences with her). Inspired, she allies with Onizuka, and helps with his troubles. Despite her switch in allegiance, Urumi continues her feud with Miyabi, until Miyabi reveals her origins to the student body. Urumi retaliates by setting up a web page, where she promises to post pictures of Miyabi in her bathroom (Urumi had earlier placed a hidden camera), after a countdown timer reaches zero. However, the site reveals only a single photograph of Urumi, Miyabi, and Tomoko Nomura during their younger years. Urumi never had any intention of ruining Miyabi; she just wanted to scare her. Urumi attempts suicide at an indoor skiing arena by freezing to death, but Onizuka rescues her. It is after this incident that Urumi considers Onizuka to be her ""favorite."" She grows extremely infatuated with Onizuka, to the point of wanting to elope with Onizuka. Urumi takes a more stereotypical role of a character that prefers the use of violence, in response to jealousy - she is often seen beating Onizuka mercilessly every time he tries to fulfill his pervertednes. Urumi states Onizuka should wait for her hormones to start kicking in, because she's sure that she would have a bouncing body by then. Like Noboru Yoshikawa, her loyalty to Onizuka is extremely strong, to the point that she would consider suicide, if he were to leave, believing that her own life is worthless without him around.

Hiroshi is easily enraged by Onizuka's behavior basically always. He shows to have no respect for school delinquents or anyway rebels guys during the series. He believes that Onizuka is the evil root of all his misfortunes. He was visibly against Onizuka's hiring, but had to accept Principal Sakurai's positive decision.

Kikuchi, Yoshito;Yoshito Kikuchi (菊地 善人);"Yoshito ""Coochie"" Kikuchi";"
Yoshito Kikuchi is one of Eikichi Onizuka's students. This computer prodigy (scoring the highest without certain ""aid"" in the country, on a standardized test) serves as class president and is also notorious for making pornographic composite photos, during Onizuka's arrival at the Holy Forest Academy. He tries to blackmail him into resignation with several pictures posted all across the school for everyone to see. Onizuka catches Kikuchi and instead of punishing him, hires him to make composite pictures of Azusa Fuyutsuki and other female teachers, much to his surprise.

Kikuchi eventually befriends Onizuka, and later helps Noboru Yoshikawa prevent Anko Uehara's mother, the president of the local Parent-Teacher Association, from getting Onizuka fired. Kikuchi is an amateur martial artist, having prior experience in judo and other techniques learned from Mayu Wakui (in the live-action, he claims he only knows it, and does not demonstrate this claim). It is revealed after the examinations that he was the one who switched Onizuka's test papers for a perfect score. When questioned about the actual results that Onizuka has, Kikuchi calculates it himself, and is thoroughly surprised at the score (it is unknown whether Onizuka actually did score perfect, or a score befitting his intelligence), and asks him directly, to which his teacher replies that he definitely received a perfect score.

In the manga, a possible relationship is hinted between him and Ai Tokiwa, after some intervention and a forced embrace from Onizuka. In the live-action, Kikuchi has a long distance relationship with Tomoko Nomura.

Nomura, Tomoko;Tomoko Nomura (野村 朋子);"Tomoko ""Big Top, Toroko, Tomo"" Nomura";"
Birthday: September 25, 1985

A student in Eikichi Onizuka's class, Tomoko Nomura has a large chest (her cup size is F), but is not too bright, leading to people calling her Toro-ko (Toro meaning ""slow"" in Japanese; she is nicknamed Slo-mo-ko in the English version). After initially messing up her role in one of Miyabi Aizawa's plans to get Onizuka fired, she is cut off from Miyabi's group. Seeing her rather slow, clumsy nature, Onizuka enters her into a local beauty contest. He even arranges two porn producer friends to dress her up for the competition. Rather than read the given script for the acting category, Onizuka gives her a couple of action figures and she ends up doing an excellent improvised piece (with Vice-Principal Uchiyamada getting an accidental role). In the anime, Onizuka throws a cellphone on stage and she leaves a sentimental message on Miyabi's answering machine instead. She doesn't win, but she gets noticed by several television producers and begins starring in various commercials. Her young male manager, impressed with her natural beauty, and after falling in love at first sight, makes it his lifetime goal to help her succeed.

She was friends with Urumi Kanzaki since childhood, and their close bond likely arose out of their opposite personalities (Tomoko is clumsy and rather docile with a heart of gold, compared to Urumi's intellect and potential to be savagely cruel).

A side-story in the manga features Tomoko and her manager, also called GTO, only it stands for Great Tomoko Oppai (Oppai meaning breasts). In it, Tomoko's manager embarks on one very madcap adventure to save her from her dubious producers. In the live-action, instead of her succeeding dramatically in subsequent episodes, she would part for an Okinawa acting school."
Yoshikawa, Noboru;Noboru Yoshikawa (吉川 のぼる);Noboru  Yoshikawa;"
A student at the Holy Forest Academy, and did not have a good time before Eikichi Onizuka arrived, being the victim of bullying, mostly from Uehara Anko and her group (Miyabi Aizawa replaces Anko's role in the live-action). He is extremely good with video games and is somewhat of an otaku, but proves to be quite handy with making things.

Anko's bullying is so bad it makes Noboru attempt to commit suicide twice, both times by leaping off the roof of the school, and both times resulting in him being saved by Onizuka, at the cost of Vice-Principal Hiroshi Uchiyamada's car. The two strike a quick friendship, which works for Onizuka, as Noboru has plenty of items that he wants to ""borrow"". His loyalty to Onizuka is by far the strongest, seen when he willingly sells his game collection to help cover Onizuka's debt.

While on the school trip to Okinawa, he gets room assigned with Anko and her friends by Onizuka. In retaliation for Onizuka and Noboru's antics, he gets tied up and led away into the dense jungle by the girls, but they all end up getting lost and rely on him for help. Despite the abuse, he saves Anko's life after she falls off a cliff, getting separated from the others. As the rest of the events of the manga unfolds, Noboru begins to enjoy Anko's company enough that she begins to feel affectionate to him."
Fuyutsuki, Azusa;Azusa Fuyutsuki (冬月 あずさ);Azusa  Fuyutsuki;"
A 22-year-old beautiful female teacher who is the heroine of the series. Unlike Onizuka, she led a relatively normal life, graduating from Waseda University. Her quiet manner and moderate ideas are misleading as she proves to be very tough on her own sometimes scaring even tough Onizuka. To prepare him for the test which would determine his teaching career, she prepares a mountain of jelly with eyes of Maguro tuna fish as fruits and imposes impossibly tough schedule that would have killed anyone or drove them mad. Her field of teaching is Kokugo or Japanese language (English in the Live Action). She, not that surprisingly, falls in love with Onizuka, but as both are quite reluctant to admit their feelings and show them in the open they claim that they are just ""friends"". It's not really a major matter to anyone else except Suguru Teshigawara, who finds it most aggravating that a woman with her qualifications would fall in love with one with such a crude background as Onizuka. She has difficulty with the female students in her class due to all the boys in her class having crushes on her but brings them around fairly quickly after Onizuka's advice. She has a younger sister named Makoto.

The Azusa Fuyutsuki portrayed in the live action drama differs greatly from the anime and manga versions. In that version, Fuyutsuki became a teacher because she felt she was forced to, and envies the life of her sister, who became a stewardess who frequently dates male celebrities (and receive some fancy gifts as well.) She eventually decides to remain a teacher thanks to some convincing from Onizuka, though the two are continuously depicted as at odds with each other with love strongly implied. The live-action version of Fuyutsuki also has a dislike for men in general, finding them too possessive over women, though Onizuka also convinces her that she too is guilty of that same sin. Interestingly, she is also present to many of the ""lessons"" that Onizuka personally teaches his students."
Murai, Kunio;Kunio Murai (村井 國男);Kunio  Murai;"
The class ""jock bully"", Kunio Murai is not very bright and loses his temper easily. When Eikichi Onizuka arrives at the Holy Forest Academy, Kunio and his gang (consisting of Kouji Fujiyoshi and Tadaaki Kusano) attempt to kill him several times with seemingly innocent pranks, such as a cockroach planted in his school lunch. The plans backfire (such as Kunio eating the cockroach, instead) and he goes insane, nearly ending up with his face impaled on a pair of razor-sharp scissors. Onizuka then takes advantage of Kunio's 27 year-old mother, Julia Murai, after trouncing Kunio at several arcade games. It is later revealed that Julia was carrying her son at the age of 13, and her parents and boyfriend abandoned her, making Kunio overprotective of his mother.

Kunio and his gang befriend Onizuka, after he saves them from a group of ruffians, but not before Onizuka joins the ruffians and has Kunio bungee jump off the Tokyo Bay Bridge. Kunio still gets very angry when Onizuka tries to make a pass at his mother, especially with the possibility that Onizuka may well be his new stepfather. His fear of a new father also rears its head when he suspects his mother may be marrying a man who resembles Dr. Elefun from Astro Boy.

In the anime, Aizawa began not to trust teachers anymore when one of her classmates got involved in a scandal due to an affair of their former instructor. From this, she and her cohorts began their quest of kicking out any teacher who will be assigned to their class. They were successful in making these teachers resign, but Onizuka...


In the manga, what drives Miyabi to go bad and lead a rebellion against teachers is an incident which occurred when she was in the 7th grade. She had been the favorite student of Mr. Ogi, teacher of Class 2-4 (the name of her class back in junior high). Ogi would praise her for her beauty and intelligence often. Miyabi misinterpreted this as Mr. Ogi having a crush on her. As a result, Miyabi began behaving and dressing in a more mature manner. She started cooking him lunch every day. She also started wearing revealing clothes ( such as miniskirts and tanktops). Instead of setting Miyabi straight, Mr. Ogi went along with it. To some degree, he did like Miyabi. He continued to praise her and accept her subtle advances. One day, Miyabi is invited to Mr. Ogi's house. She goes, thinking he is going to confess his love for her. As soon as she gets there, Mr. Ogi introduces her to his fiance. Miyabi storms off in tears, feeling hurt and used. As revenge, Miyabi takes illicit photos of herself and goes into class the next morning telling her classmates that Mr. Ogi raped her and then took pictures (knowing that Mr. Ogi's hobby is photography). Since that day, Miyabi has hated teachers."

He convinces Simon to help him with his plan to drill through the roof of the village and get to the world above, but the plan failed and he was put in prison. He left the village shortly thereafter with the help of Simon and a young girl named Yoko, as a result of fighting a Gunmen, who broke into the village from the surface.

After he, Simon, and Yoko break through, they meet many enemies and friends as they go, to the point of building up a resistance force, the Gurren Brigade to fight in their war against the Beastmen Empire who hunt on human beings who live on surface, and becoming their leader.

Kamina gets fatally injured during the battle to capture the enemy’s moving fortresses belonging to one of the Four Divine Generals, Thymilph. Heavily wounded Kamina combines with Simon to form Gurren Lagann and defeats the Beastman General with his signature move: ""Giga Drill Break.""

Simon is the protagonist of the story, a short and un-intimidating fourteen year old boy at the beginning of this tale. He was born in Jiiha Village and was raised by his parents until the age of seven, when his parents were killed in an underground avalanche caused by an earthquake. Their deaths traumatized Simon to the point of both hating and fearing life underground, and likely played a role in developing his relationship with Kamina. Ironically, Simon's role in his community was to dig more tunnels and caverns to expand Jiiha Village deeper underground.

Though valued as a skilled digger, Simon was ignored by the adults of his village and snubbed by the girls, who considered him disgusting. Along with his fear of earthquakes, Simon developed low self-esteem and had many cowardly tendencies. His only friend and role model growing up was Kamina, a brash and eccentric older boy who had an obsession with escaping the underground world for the surface, which he visited as a child with his father. Simon was slowly ""recruited"" into Team Gurren along with several other boys, and lead by Kamina made several attempts to reach the surface over several years. During one attempt, a sudden earthquake trapped Team Gurren within a chamber and cut off the supply of oxygen. Simon began to panic, but after inspiration from Kamina he managed to dig all of the Team Gurren members out of danger. Yoko would later recall that Kamina himself was terrified during this incident, but he hid his fear from Simon knowing Simon was the only one capable of rescuing his gang.

One day during the digging of a new tunnel, Simon discovers a small drill-shaped object that periodically glows. Later that day, he unearths a large ""face"" in the ground, which he shows to Yoko and Kamina after Jiiha Village is attacked by a large Gunmen. The face is revealed to be a miniature Gunmen, and the object Simon dug up the key to starting it up. With the aid of this mech, which Kamina names ""Lagann"", Simon destroys the large Gunmen attacking Jiiha and rises to the surface world.

A mysterious young girl found sleeping in a capsule in the middle of a dump site by Simon. She had no prior contact with humans, except her father, who is also the sovereign of the Beastmen, the Spiral King. She is very curious, pure and innocent, due to growing up sheltered in a peaceful environment, away from all the battles occurring in the outside world. Despite early misgivings, she is quickly accepted by Team Dai-Gurren, much to the (initial) irking of Yoko.


During her journey, she develops a strong empathy towards Simon and grows to be his fiancé. After her encounters with Divine Generals Adiane and Guame, she comes to an understanding of the reason Simon found her outside the palace, being forsaken by her father after she started attaining her own will and self-consciousness, as he considered his offspring merely toys to play with as dolls, and decides to join The Team Dai-Gurren as a cook (even though her cooking is unbearable to anybody but Simon) in order to confront her father. In the final battle with Lord Genome, she boards Lagann with Simon and aids him in the destruction of Lord Genome. Seven years after Teppelin's fall, Nia and Simon are engaged, but soon after she is overtaken by the Anti-Spiral race to become a digital messenger.

After the defeat of the Anti-Spirals she and Simon get married, though she begins to fade away before the shocked crowd but an unsurprised Simon. She tells Simon she loves him and he answers back saying that he will never forget her ""till the end of the universe"". Nia corrects him, stating it will never end and that's what they'd worked so hard for. She smiles as Simon says he loves her and she fades away. Nia's memorial site is near the graves of Kamina and the members of Team Dai-Gurren who died fighting the Anti-Spiral. Her memorial has the flowers she held at the wedding along with a sword.

Gender: Male
Species: Shark/Cat Beastmen
Occupation: Vice Commander/Warrior/Team Dai-Gurren Member
Relationships: Kamina (rival), Simon (rival/ally), Thymilph (superior officer), Adiane (superior officer), Cytomander (superior officer), Lord Genome (king)
Gunmen: Enki, Enkidu, Dai-Gunkai (temporarily), Enkidudu, Gurren, Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann, Enkidududu (drama cd), Enkidudududu (drama cd), Dai-Gunzankai (drama cd), Tengen Toppa Enki Dulga (Lagann-hen)

Viral is a recurring enemy and later an important ally to Team Dai-Gurren in the japanese anime Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann. He is a shark-type Beastman with feline genetics. His appearance is more humanoid than most other Beastmen, except for his cat-like eyes, shark-like teeth, and large clawed paws in place of hands. He is skilled in piloting Gunmen, as well as in unarmed combat. While hunting for food, he attacks Kamina when he found, running into his Gunmen Enki after Yoko intervene in a ensuing fight between the two. He manages to overcome Simon and Kamina's attacks, but leaves before the fight ends. The next day, Viral returns to execute his mission as member of the Human Execution Squad, facing Kamina and Simon again; this time however, Viral is defeated by the newly formed Gurren-Lagann, barraging it missiles in order to conceal his escape, swearing revenge on Kamina for his humiliation when he took Enki's helmet in the fight.

Viral later returns alongside Supreme General Thymilph and the Dai-Gunzan to crush Team Gurren with the upgraded Enkidu, but is severely injured in the battle, which resulted in the Dai-Gurren's capture and the death of his superior. He tries to obtain another chance to fight by trying to join Supreme General Adiane's side, in spite of her treating him like garbage as she blames him for Thymilph's demise. Still, Viral saved Adiane from harm during a fight with Team Dai-Gurren, by stopping the Dai-Gurren's foot from crushing her. After Adiane's death by the Dai-Gurren's attack and being the only survivor of the Dai-Gunkai, Viral curses the Gurren-Lagann and swears to bring pain and punishment to those who killed his two superiors and robbing him of a honor.

Under Supreme General Cytomander's command, Viral took part on the aerial attack on the Dai-Gurren. His battle with the Gurren-Lagann, piloted by Simon and Yoko, extended to the control room of Cytomander's aerial fortress, the Dai-Gunten. There, he learned of Kamina's death, and discovered that he not only lost to a human, but to a child as well, challenging Simon to a one-on-one duel in their mecha. But the battle was interrupted by Cytomander, who took Yoko hostage, and ordered Viral to destroy the defenseless Gurren-Lagann. However, Viral disobeyed as he knew this outcome would not make him regain his lost pride and honor. For this action, Cytomander asked the Spiral King's permission to execute him for treason, but Viral's last request was hearing from the King himself of what is the true nature of human race. Thus, Lord Genome dispenses Cytomander and conducts Viral to a room where he reveals the truth behind the Beastmen's existance before making him immortal. Viral's last effort against the Gurren-Lagann was in the Spiral King's throne room, where he believed he could finally obtain his vengeance after becoming immortal, but was soundly defeated. Lord Genome revealed that the reason he gave Viral immortality was not to fight against Simon, as none without ""Spiral Energy"" could stand against his power, but to make of him as an eternal witness of his triumph against Team Dai-Gurren.


After Lord Genome's defeat and the fall of Teppelin, Viral's whereabouts were unknown, until he was sighted causing an uproar with his Gunmen, and demanding Simon to fight him, but Rossiu stopped Simon from going after him and sent their Guraparl force instead. Gimmy and Darry together managed to take down Viral's Enkidudu and put him under custody. When questioned by Simon about why he continues to fight even after the war ended, Viral stated that his intention was to protect a human settlement which refused to leave the underground. Simon would eventually discover that Rossiu was forcing people out of their villages without his consent, in order to count them to find out how close mankind's population was from reaching the one million danger level, stated by Lord Genome. Viral is sent to the Rikone prison and reappears in the end of episode 19, when he re-encounters Simon, who was imprisoned there, awaiting for his death sentence to be carried on. Both end up locked in individual cells after a brawl, but after Simon is rescued by Yoko, Viral is also released by him and accepts his proposal to join Team Dai-Gurren against the Anti-Spirals, as the Gurren's pilot. This position is cemented after the battle, when Simon declares him the Gurren's official pilot in a meeting with the Team members; this title goes uncontested. In episode 26, we discover that Viral's greatest desire is to have a family, however, this will always be impossible, since Beastmen cannot reproduce. Despite being a Beastman, he obtains a Core Drill when broken free from the Anti-Spiral's illusion, even though Beastmen should not be able to produce Spiral Energy. In the epilogue, Viral is seen commanding the Chouginga Dai-Gurren, as a representative for Earth, in the upcoming Spiral Peace Conference; due to his immortality, his appearance stays the same, in spite of the fact that 20 years have passed.
Viral's name comes directly from the word ""viral,"" tying in with the Beastmen's genetics theme, but there are other theories about his name's origin. One is the fact that it can also be an anagram for ""rival,"" referring to his constant rivalry with Kamina, which transfered to Simon throughout the series until near the end. Another possible theory comes from the Nikopol Trilogy of comic books written by Enki Bilal, as Enki is the name of Viral's first Gunmen and ""Bilal,"" pronounced in Japanese, sounds like ""Viral."" Supporting this theory is Viral's theme song, which is titled ""Nikopol,"" on the anime's soundtrack.

The name of Viral's Gunmen may be tied to the Sumerian diety Enki, though it is much more likely that there is a deliberate connection between his second Gunmen, Enkidu, and the character of Enkidu from the Epic of Gilgamesh. The myth consists of Enkidu (""Enki's creation""), a man of the wild who seeks to challenge King Gilgamesh, a mighty warrior, but who later befriends him and assists him in in his travels."

Lordgenome;Lordgenome  (ロージェノム);"Lordgenome ""Spiral King"" ";"
Lordgenome is the ominous Spiral King, who rules the planet from his capitol city, Teppelin. An immortal human who lived for more than 1000 years so far, he cares little for people, treating the strange girls he surrounds himself with as dolls to be cast aside when they've outlived their interest to him. From Guame we find out that Lordgenome despises human consciousness and self-awareness although we are yet to be given a reason for this dislike.


When Simon and Nia finally reach him, he claims that the act of trapping the humans underground and hunting down those who live on the surface is a means he has found to protect mankind, because according to him, when the population of humans on the surface reach one million, a terrible fate will fall upon them. He also shares the fact that he and Simon share the same ""Spiral"" powers, before being defeated via being stabbed in the chest by Simon's Core Drill.

In episode 18, Lordgenome's memories are retrieved by Rossiu's research team, and he reveals to Rossiu the truth about the Anti-Spirals, and the reason why he forced mankind to live underground in order to control its population. It is also revealed that at one time Lordgenome had even been part of a group that fought against the Anti-Spirals, the Spiral Knights, who fought and protected the galaxy from the Anti-Spiral menace. In the end, however, the Spiral Tribe lost the war, and the Anti-Spiral Tribe (The Han-Rasen Tribe) gained control of the universe.

Lordgenome's revived head was used to control the massive spaceship Arc-Gurren. According to Leeron, the ship only reacts to him just like the Lagann only works with Simon. After the Gurren Brigade gained control of the Cathedral Terra, it was relocated there, apparently for the same reason.

Gender: Male
Family: Hiroko Makunouchi (Mother); Kazuo Makunouchi (Father); Wanpo (Pet)
Occupation: Professional Boxer; Makunouchi Fishing Boat
Weight Class: Featherweight
Height: 164 cm (5'5"")
Reach: 165 cm (65"")
Style: Infighter; Peek-A-Boo Style
Current Affiliation: Kamogawa Boxing Gym
Trainer: Genji Kamogawa
Specialty: Liver Blow; Gazelle Punch; Dempsey Roll

Ippo Makunouchi is the main protagonist of the series. He lives with his mother, Hiroko Makunouchi, and helps with the family charter boat fishing business. Ippo is a classic power in-boxer and is well known for his Peek-a-Boo style of boxing and hard punches which include three signature punches: a rib-cracking liver blow, Gazelle punch (an uppercut variant), and the Dempsey roll technique. His signature punches appear to be modelled after Mike Tyson, Floyd Patterson and Jack Dempsey respectively.

Ippo is bullied throughout most of his school life. After being rescued by Takamura, he ends up being brought to Kamogawa Gym, where he displays an explosive punching power. After seeing a video of Mike Tyson, he becomes inspired to take up boxing to feel reborn with strength. He soon proves himself to Takamura and Kamogawa, and starts on the path to being a pro boxer.

His Pro-Debut Match was against Oda Yusuke, He was largely regarded as a lazy and unmotivated boxer, but when his girlfriend threatened to break up with him, he committed himself to training. From the first time the boxers met, there was tension between them, as a misunderstanding led Oda to believe Ippo made fun of him. On the actual fight, Ippo seemed to have the advantage from the beginning of the match, but was saved by his coach from losing the fight due to a cut. Ippo managed a comeback by knocking Oda out with a series of jabs, thus winning the fight.


After winning two fights upon his debut as a pro-boxer, Coach Kamogawa enlisted Ippo in the East Japan Rookie King Tournament. Ippo also had his personal goal in the tournament to fight with Miyata in the Pro Ring for their tie-breaker match. With this promise in mind Ippo aims to reach the East Japan finals. First Round: Jason Ozuma Ozuma is a black officer from America who was stationed in Japan, and the only black boxer Ippo has faced so far. Jason is a very polite and kind man who cares greatly for his gym and friends. His most revered attacks, his devastating Hooks, are comparable to Takamura's in terms of speed. Ippo had to enter an in fight to win the first round. Ippo took major hits, but managed to turn the match around by pressuring Ozuma with his power. After an intense round, Ippo managed to take advantage of Ozuma's wide swing and his delayed punch, due to a broken rib, to deliver a second down and win the match. Second Round: Kobashi Kenta Kobashi Kenta is a boxer that depends on winning with points. Ippo is annoyed by Kobashi's technique, which is to clinch often; eventually Kobashi's strategy, to rob Ippo of his stamina, takes effect. However, in the final round (the 4th round), Kobashi punches Ippo with a counter and becomes excited at the prospect of landing a KO on Ippo. Even though his second disapproved, his desire to gain a KO victory lead him to fight head-on, but Ippo took his chance the instant Kobashi stepped outside the pure, no-risk outboxing and KO'ed him. Semi-final Round: Hayami Ryuuichi A pretty boy boxer who held the title of Inter High Champion with his fast barrage of punches called the Shotgun and Ippo's first opponent as an out boxer. Hayami looked down upon Ippo, and dismissed him since he felt Ippo was an unworthy opponent. Hayami's strategy uses a short uppercut against dashing infighters and finishes them with his Shotgun. Ippo, however, manages to counter him by using a cross hook counter against his short uppercut, and sees through the storm of punches. Having finally mastered bobbing and weaving at the training camp, he was able to avoid and get close to Hayami. Ippo finished the fight with a rush followed by an uppercut to win the fight in 1 round moving to the finals. East Japan Final Round: Mashiba Ryou Ippo's final opponent in the East Japan Rookie King tournament defeated Miyata with a controversial foul and seemed poised to take the Rookie King Title. Ippo met Mashiba at his pro license exam, and has since been afraid of his dark demeanor throughout most of the series (albeit comically), but after witnessing Mashiba's foul, Ippo goes into the match determined to win. Initially, Mashiba's flicker jabs exploited Ippo's short reach by keeping him at bay, but Ippo eventually slipped in, broke Mashiba's elbow (at the expense of his right hand), and slugged it out with him. Ippo gave Mashiba his first and only legitimate black star in the form of a heavy and painful K.O victory.

Since Ippo had broken his fist, the All Japan Round didn't seem like a possibility, but when Ippo met Sendou, the West Japan Rookie King, in person, he decided to go ahead with the fight. He received therapy from Doctor Yamaguchi which allowed him to fight with a proper hand. The match was an intense slug-fight which ended abruptly before the fourth round when Sendou turned out to be unconscious in his corner, despite still sitting upright looking ready to continue.

After winning the All Japan Rookie Tournament, Ippo found that his rival Miyata was going overseas. Ippo was left with no current goal to motivate him. Rehabilitating his hand injured from his previous fight, Ippo breaks from training and starts supporting his fellow boxers at Kamogawa Gym in their fights. He then meets the current National Feather Weight Champion Date Eiji, who hints that in the future they may face each other since Ippo is already ranked number 10 upon winning the Rookie King Tournament. Ippo realizes that he wants to fight the Champion and trains for his new challenge. And he proceeds to do this by entering an A class tournemant and defeating Okita Keigo, Saeki Takuma and Alexander Volg Zangief. Date Eiji After earning his right to challenge Date Eiji, one of Japan's most revered boxers, Ippo went into the match bringing everything he had learned in his past 10 matches with him. For the first few rounds he succeeded in pushing the champion to his limits. However, when Eiji began using the high-level Neck Spin to negate most of the power behind Ippo's punches, Ippo becomes disoriented. Eiji gradually returns to his style of fighting from his younger days. He delivers a powerful Heart Break Shot that stuns Ippo, then prepares to deliver the finishing blow. But the referee stops the match because Kamogawa had already thrown in the towel. Victory goes to Date Eiji. Thanks to this match, Date regains his confidence in challenging the world champion, Ricardo Martinez. He relinquishes his belt, leaving Sendou Takeshi and Alexander Volg Zangief to fight for it. Sendou wins by a controversial decision and becomes the new Japanese Featherweight champion. Ponchai Chuwatana A Thai fighter ranked 3rd in Thailand who faces Ippo following his 5 month break against Date Eiji. Ponchai had a very well-built physique and a strong determination to win in his boxing matches.in the second round, Ippo starts to land small punches while swaying left and right, before speeding up and finishing Ponchai off with his new finishing move, the ""Dempsey Roll.""After this match, Sendou, the new featherweight champion, challenged Ippo to a match personally. Sendou Takeshi The continuation of the unfinished match between the hard punchers of East and West. Ippo and Sendou had been looking forward to a match since the All Japan Rookie Championship was unfinished in their minds. To prepare for the match they both strengthened their weaknesses through new training methods, Sendou improving his lower body and Ippo his upper body. This match is considered to be one of the most intense since both fighters had roughly the same amount of punching power resulting in numerous slug fests and a footstomp from the audience that shook the hall. Ippo originally had problems since he had a smaller body, meaning he had a little bit less muscle and was going to lose unless he started to connect more punches than Sendou did. But with encouragement from his friends and remembering his training he managed to continue his match against Sendou. The match turned into a mix up, where both fighters drew out the others' potential and helped each other grow stronger. With one final showdown between their signature finishers, Ippo managed to pull through and finish Sendou off by inventing a combo of his 3 strongest techniques to take the belt and title. Sendou then personally congratulated Ippo.

After obtaining the National Japanese Feather Weight Belt from Sendou, Ippo defended the title successfully for eight consecutive times.

After yet another canceled fight with Ichiro Miyata, Ippo lost his drive and thought of retiring from boxing. However with the help of Iimura Mari and the words of his friends and previous opponent, he was able to find his true goal which is to become strong and went back to Kamogawa Gym to continue Boxing. Kamogawa then tells Ippo to aim for the World, but having them cut off the shortest route of getting to the top rankings by beating the OPBF Champ Miyata, Kamogawa tells Ippo that he will take a different path, which is to defeat all of the OPBF National Champions, obtaining their WBC rankings and becoming an unofficial OPBF Champion.

After his fight with Kojima, Ippo was told by the coach that he would be relinquishing the JBC Featherweight Title and moving up to challenging world rankers. His first match as a world contender is against Alfredo Gonzales, the 2nd ranked Featherweight in the WBA and 3rd ranked Featherweight in the WBC. in the 7th round, the boxers enter yet another exchange which Ippo wins, but as he goes for the finishing blow, Alfredo lands a powerful right counter and sends Ippo to the canvas, where he lays motionless. Kamogawa runs into the ring to help Ippo and the referee declares a TKO. As of this fight, Alfredo is the second person to knock Ippo unconscious.

Height: 185 cm (6'1"")
Reach: 189 cm (74"")
Style: Hybrid
Stance(s): Orthodox Stance, Brawling Stance, Hitman Style
Current Affiliation: Kamogawa Boxing Gym
Trainer: Kamogawa Genji

He is a multi-weight class (currently middleweight) hybrid boxer affiliated with the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. He is the current unified WBC and WBA Middleweight champion and strongest known character in the series.

Takamura is very hearty, rude and often behaves vulgarly. He is a loud arrogant boaster who tends to refer to himself as Ore-sama (a Japanese name suffix intended for people of great importance) and he rarely ever shows a shred of consideration towards other fighters after a loss.

Takamura was discovered on the streets by Coach Kamogawa Genji, and his speed, power, and technique are all high-level to the point that he is capable of handling both In Fighters and Out Boxers without too much trouble. Unlike most characters in Hajime no Ippo, he has no special finishing blow, but every punch he has possesses killer destructive power. With the wild power to always force out any situation he claims will happen, he is a man who does everything he says he will.

As the one who got Ippo, Aoki and Kimura into boxing, he is well respected at the Kamogawa Gym. Even though he constantly looks down on and ridicules their achievements, his unrivalled strength and the few moments his true kindness leaks out prevent them from losing their respect for him. Takamura loves to pick on his fellow gym mates, with Aoki usually the first on his list. Although he tends to get more serious when hearing about or training for his next match, he still finds the time to play pranks on everyone and goof around.

He is the current WBC and WBA World Middleweight Champion and former WBC Junior Middleweight Champion. He was also the JBC Middleweight Champion, but relinquished it after 4 title defenses. He lives alone at the Ohta Inn apartment complex, and his room is littered with junk, old food, pornography, and even his Belts. He still lives there even after becoming World Champion, preferring a simple life.


Takamura's one weakness is his arrogance and temper, as he is able to be easily provoked by many of his opponents, he also has in two occasions felt the compulsive need to finish his fights with 1-Hit KOs (Due to Miyata getting too much attention, and Ippo scoring a 1-Hit KO), which led to him almost losing against opponents a lot weaker than him. Like Miyata, Takamura is constantly struggling with weight control, so he is prone to losing stamina slightly quicker due to fighting in weight-classes below his natural weight. Aside from that the only times Takamura has been in trouble is when an opponent reads his attacks, but he just keeps trying until he finds a way to connect. In both his matches with Eagle and Bison, Takamura's right eye (or at least his field of vision on his right side) played a key role in his opponents gaining the upper hand. This suggests he may have a detached retina in his right eye, though this is not confirmed by the manga.
The character for Taka (鷹) in his name means hawk, and as a result he is sometimes nicknamed The Japanese Hawk by announcers and spectators (most notably during his matches against Brian Hawk and David Eagle). He lives alone at the Ohta Inn apartment complex, and his room is littered with junk, old food, pornography, and even his boxing belts. His pompadour hairstyle is his trademark.

Style: Unorthodox boxing style
Stance: Orthodox Stance
Current affiliation: Kamogawa Boxing Gym
Trainer: Shinoda

He is an unorthodox lightweight boxer and one of the core members of the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. He, along with Kimura Tatsuya, are known to have been scouted into boxing by Takamura Mamoru, an individual they swore to defeat but eventually came to admire.

Aoki was a punk from his childhood up through high school, at which point he encountered, fought and got beat down by Takamura Mamoru (who was then a middleweight with two wins under his belt). This loss motivated him to quit school along with his close friend Kimura Tetsuya to become boxers at Kamogawa gym. Although their initial goal was to land a clean hit on Takamura, they grew to love boxing and develop their own skills. Aoki became a clownish boxer whose signature techniques, the Frog Punch and Look-Away, eventually led him to a draw in a Japanese title match with then-champion Imae Katsuka. Currently in the series, Aoki had a going rivalry with Papaya Dachiu, the lightweight champion of the Philippnes, with whom he has drawn two consecutive matches.

In a flashback shown in the series, Aoki is known for his troubled school life as a delinquent. He, along with long-time friend Kimura, were known to participate in countless fights and brawls with 'rival' schools. Throughout the series Aoki has shown a rather playful, immature, and mischievous personality- an attitude he reflects in his boxing matches where (due to his comparatively unexceptional boxing skills) he constantly thinks of methods to to deceive, confuse, or even ridicule opponents to a certain extent. A very long-running gag is that Aoki keeps revealing impressing talents, that sadly have no connection with boxing. Another one involves his girlfriend's friendship with Kumi that has made made contacting her far more easy than Ippo could ever hope, so Aoki often helps him out. His prankster personality extends to his own teammates and is most notably reflected in his attitude towards Makunouchi Ippo and (at times) Takamura Mamoru. Together with Kimura he is paired into the Aokimura duo by Itagaki Manabu.

Aoki's taste in women is seen as a running joke in the Hajime no Ippo series where, in contrast to the tastes of his gym mates, Aoki places his preferences in women considered 'ugly' by everyone else. This may be due to an incident where he was cruelly dumped by a beautiful girl, psychologically turning him to prefer uglier girls. Even though he may have a taste for ""ugly"" girls, he is able to hold a girlfriend, Tomiko, longer then any of the other guys with the exception of Ippo but it remains to be seen if he and Kumi will ultimately be together.


For the most part Aoki's fights in the series are not as major or impactive on the general storyline. However, in his most recent fight against Iga Shinobu (and his coach Kurita Baron, a former member of the Kamogawa Gym), Aoki was beaten badly and landed himself in the hospital. Given the option to retire with Kimura after their considerably lengthy careers Aoki refuses, and is determined then to stay in the lightweight class until he defeats Iga, whom he now considers his goal and rival. Takamura is then seen commenting on how stubborn both Aoki and Kimura are.

Kamogawa Genji is a deuteragonist in Hajime no Ippo. His influence on the story rivals those of Takamura Mamoru's and Miyata Ichirou's; all three inspire Makunouchi Ippo to continue boxing.

Kamogawa is the head coach of the Kamogawa Boxing Gym and is close friends with Nekota Ginpachi and Hama Dankichi. As a coach he is strict and holds high expectations for his trainees but is also shown to genuinely care for the well-being of his fighters (albeit in a more silenced, aloof way), forging a strong bond with each and every one of them through trust and spirit. He possesses an extremely sharp sense for boxing and a large wealth of knowledge in regards to boxing, able to give strategies to his fighters that often cause turnabouts in matches. He is shown throughout the series to be most proud of his two most prominent boxers: Takamura Mamoru and Makunouchi Ippo.

He is a retired boxer who founded the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. He acts as the trainer of both Ippo and Takamura,as well as a cornerman for the boxers under Shinoda Tomoyuki.

Kamogawa worked as a prizefighter in Japan shortly after the end of the Second World War. He has exchanged blows with former prizefighter Nekota Ginpachi multiple times. He was also friends with fellow prizefighter and future trainer Hama Dankichi. During the American occupation of Japan, Kamogawa harboured strong feelings of national pride, refusing to accept food handouts.

Sometime later, Kamogawa opened his own boxing gym, where he trained the future manager of the gym Yagi-chan, the then-OPBF Featherweight champion Miyata-san, and the budding counter specialist Miyata Ichirou. By chance, he encountered Takamura Mamoru and convinced him to enter the world of boxing under his tutorship. Takamura then scouted Aoki Masaru, Kimura Tatsuya, and Makunouchi Ippo to the gym.

Though he chose not to train Itagaki Manabu, he is present in his matches as a cornerman. He is equally as surprised at Itagaki's speed and boxing skills as he is at the talents of his own trainees.

Ippo's senpai and Aoki's best friend. He is the smooth, collected type and a romantic at heart, but trains as hard as anyone. His style incorporates a fast left and faster footwork. In the past, he and Aoki were the toughest high-school thugs around, but now Tatsuya's real job is at his family's flower shop. He is a junior lightweight boxer. Along with Makunouchi Ippo, Takamura Mamoru, Aoki Masaru, and Itagaki Manabu, he rounds out the core members of the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. His main fights in the series are against Mashiba Ryou and Eleki Battery.

Kimura and Aoki Masaru were best friends since kindergarten. In high school they began brawling and causing trouble with students from rival schools, namely North High, which eventually led to their expulsion. Kimura was the most affected by this because he was worried he had disappointed his mother. One day the pair attacked North High's Takamura Mamoru and lost miserably. Seeing Takamura's strength as a boxer, they decided to join the Kamogawa Boxing Gym to try and become strong too.

Kimura became a delincuent beacuse he was bullied by an older boy, and when his father went to confront the boy's father, he was pressured and ended up apologizing, this made Kimura lose all respect for his father, becoming more violent in both his house and in the outside, and decided to quit highschool without his parents knowing.

Like Aoki, his boxing ability is also downplayed for much of the series (albeit not quite as badly). Despite this, he has proven to be a good boxer with solid all-around ability. Miyata stated that as a boxer, Kimura had no weaknesses (despite also not having any strengths) and Miyata's father said that although he was only ranked third before his fight with Mashiba, his talent surpassed that ranking. Mashiba himself admitted that Kimura was his strongest challenger. He shows strength around the level of a national champion, as he was able to draw with Eleki Battery twice and only barely lost to Mashiba.

As fast outboxer, Kimura is often asked to be a sparring partner for as Makunouchi and one time for Miyata, though Kimura benefited more from Miyata's sparring.


After losing to Ryo Mashiba, he announced his retirement from boxing.Shortly after, unable to stay away from boxing, he returned saying he would spell his name in katakana (タツヤ) instead of kanji (達也).


Kimura's main role in the story is that of a supporting character, but upon his and Aoki's second entry into the Class A Tournament, they became directly antagonized by Iga Shinobu and his trainer, Baron Kurita. They are now both aiming to settle their grudge with the duo.

Itagaki, Manabu;Manabu Itagaki (板垣 学 );"Manabu ""Speed King, The Genius, Chronos"" Itagaki";"
Birthday: August 14, 1975
Homeland: Japan Tokyo,
Occupation: Professional Boxer, Makunouchi Fishing Boat worker
Weight Class: Featherweight
Height: 168 cm (5'6"")
Reach: 168 cm (66"")
Style: Out Boxer
Stance: Orthodox Stance
Current Affiliation: Kamogawa Boxing Gym
Trainer: Shinoda

The most recent addition to the roster, the charming Manabu has a prodigy's talent and was the captain of his high school's boxing team. Cheerful and a lover of bad puns, Manabu is a fierce outboxer with extremely high speed and reflexes and whose fighting style is uncanny in its resemblance to Miyata's. His most powerful technique is a furious hail of mid-power blows known as the Hedgehog or Porcupine, which was employed in an East Japan Rookie Kings showdown with his longtime nemesis, Kyosuke Imai. Outside of boxing, Manabu is employed as an assistant at the Makounouchi family's fishing business. Itagaki's character is based on former world champion Oscar de La Hoya for his prodigy-like natural ability and good looks, whom Itagaki has admitted to idolizing in the manga.

He is a Featherweight out boxer renowned for his speed and genius boxing talent. His trainer is Shinoda Tomoyuki. He, along with Makunouchi Ippo, Takamura Mamoru, Aoki Masaru, and Kimura Tatsuya, round out the core members of the Kamogawa Boxing Gym.

Itagaki originally tried out and prevailed at many sports, but when he tried boxing he came across Imai Kyousuke and was defeated by him 3 times. In order to defeat him no matter what, he skipped college and instead joined the Kamogawa Boxing Gym, where his idol, Ippo, trained.

After Umezawa Masahiko retired from the Makunouchi Fishing Boat in order to pursue his own dreams, Itagaki took over his job and started receving the same kind of work training that Ippo goes through. He achieved revenge on Makino Fumito, who had defeated him in his debut match with a foul, in the opening round of the East Japan Rookie Kings. At the finals, after a tough fight with Imai, Itagaki captured the East Japan Rookie King title and seemingly tapped into his true fighting potential; his speed, reflexes and timing are now said to be at genius levels.


With Ippo relinquishing his title to take on the world, a rematch with number 2 ranking and long time rival Imai was scheduled to decide the new JBC featherweight champion. Although it was a title match, because Itagaki had conquered his goal in the Class A tournament to beat Ippo's KO times against Saeki and Karasawa, as well as because he had defeated Imai before, he went into the match extremely overconfident. With a dazzling strategy, Kyousuke trapped Itagaki in the corner and wore him out with various body blows, eventually KOing Itagaki in the first round. Afterward, Itagaki acted like a good sportsman, but in truth he was disappointed in himself for letting down Ippo and dropping Date's baton.

Sendo, Takeshi;Takeshi Sendo (千堂 武士);"Takeshi ""Rocky, Naniwa Tiger"" Sendo";"
Birth date: May 5, 1972
Homeland: Japan, Osaka.
Occupation: Professional Boxer, Marketplace Owner (with grandmother)
Weight Class: Featherweight
Height: 167.5 cm (5'5"")
Reach: 168 cm (66"")
Style In Fighter: Brawling Style, Crouching Style
Stance: Brawling Stance
Current Affiliation: Naniwa Kentou-kai
Trainer: Yanaoka

He is a Featherweight boxer from the Naniwa Kentou Boxing Gym and a former JBC Featherweight Champion. He played the main antagonist during the events of championship road, serving as the second Japanese champion Ippo faced for the title.
Sendou's father was a fireman who died while saving the life of a child. Like Ippo, Sendou looked up to his father greatly, and this loss inspired him to try to be as strong as his father.

Sendo is an In Fighter with arm strength on par with Makunouchi Ippo. To date, he is the only boxer to face Ippo more than once in the pro ring and is his chief rival. Sendo is a featherweight and his most well known move is his powerful smash. He greatly admires boxer Rocky Marciano, to the extent that he will personally point out that he is not the same ""Rocky"" from the film of the same name. He is also a fan of Takamura Mamoru.

He is first introduced watching a tape of Makunouchi Ippo's spectacular KO victory against Mashiba Ryou and, fired up by the tape, decides to go visit Tokyo for a match against Ippo. He leaves half-disappointed however when he learns of Ippo's broken fist, but declares hopefully to Ippo that he would be ""waiting for [him] in Osaka'"" when the time comes for their match, accidentally leaving a bag of souvenirs at the station upon his leave.

Since young, Sendou was known to be rude and problematic, having lead his own delinquent gang in the streets. However, it is mentioned by his grandma that Sendou did so to protect innocent civilians from other delinquent gangs. He and his grandmother run a market place.

Disheartened, Sendou does not put much effort into his training until a package arrives in the mail, along with a letter from Ippo stating that they may be able to have their match after all. Renewed by the prospective match Sendou quickly jumps back into intense training, waiting for the day of his match against Ippo.


Despite all his training for the match, Sendou ultimately loses consciousness in his own corner before the start of the fourth round. However, both fighters agree that unless one collapses in the ring, the fight remains unfinished. The two fighters then anxiously wait for the day of their rematch. Sendou is seen again after Date Eiji's relinquishing of the JBC Featherweight belt. He wins a very close, and controversial, victory by decision against Volg Zangief to acquire the vacant title. His first title defense is against Saeki Takuma, whom he KO's with little difficulty. Afterwards, he is pitted against Shigeta Akira, whose provocations of his and Ippo's style of boxing led Sendou to beat Akira so ferociously that he contracted a fear of being punched (and presumably retired) thereafter. Sendou and Ippo then have their promised rematch for the belt. He once again loses, this time by way of knockout from his 'rival'.

Sendou has a semi-final match before Takamura's world title unification bout against Richard Bison. Because he brawled with Mashiba in the waiting room before the fight, he enters the ring with bruises on his face. He is up against a Mexican World ranker once again, Jose Nargo who is fairly strong as he is ranked 5th in the WBA, who is already called a champ. Also this time to defend his position of being ranked 4th in the WBA. Jose Nargo dominated Sendou for most of the match because of his experience with sparring Ricardo Martinez. After the 8th round, when Sendou saw Ricardo's Manager, Bill Stewart as his second, he then pushes Jose to the corner and using his knuckles started to press into Jose's stomach aggressively, causing extreme pain and giving Sendou the opportunity to knock Jose out. Sendou defends his ranking of being 4th in the WBA, and might proceed to a title match. After defeating Jose Nargo, he then speaks to Bill Stewart, telling him to give a warning to Alfredo Gonzalez, which shocks Bill as he expected the warning to be given to Ricardo. He then goes back to the room, to watch the match of Takamura with Mashiba. To this point they seem to be okay with each other and not fighting as they discuss how tough Richard Bison is, but they will continue after this match as they say with each other silently...
Sendo is modeled after the real-life ""Naniwa Rocky"", boxer turned actor Akai Hidekazu.

Miyata, Ichirou;Ichirou Miyata (宮田 一郎);"Ichirou ""The Prince of Counters, The Lightning God"" Miyata";"
Date of birth: August 27, 1973
Nationality: Japanese
Boxing style: Out Boxer, Counter-Puncher
Height: 5'7.5"" (172.0 cm)
Reach: 69"" (175.4 cm)
Weight: 126 lbs.
Weight class: Featherweight
Gym affiliation: Kawabara Gym
Specialty: Various counters, Speed Hell
Stance: Orthodox Stance , Detroit Style, Hitman Style (once)


Ichiro Miyata is an out-boxer known for his speed, timing and determination. His normal punches are light but he is an expert at using counters that are all potential Sunday punches. Miyata is one of Ippo's primary goals as a boxer.

Ever since he was little, Miyata has always wanted to be like his dad. His dad, Suzuki Miyata, used to be a boxer, until a career-ending jaw bone injury forced him to retire. Miyata takes his training dead seriously, and has always believed in his father's old beliefs, that skill can beat strength. You hardly ever see the guy smile because he thinks that he doesn't have the privilege to smile unless he wins a boxing match.


He had worked his way up to almost the top of the featherweight Rookie King championship, until Ryo Mashiba beat him in a match. Miyata ended up in the hospital with a broken foot, as well as some other injuries. Miyata then left Japan to fill the gap between himself and Ippo. He now holds the OPBF Featherweight title and has defended it five times. Due to his promise with Ippo and his determination to prove his father's boxing to the world, Miyata restricts himself to the Featherweights and as a consequence suffers from severe weight control, which lowers his match stamina and strength while making him more susceptible to damage.


He was supposed to fight Ippo as promised at that point, but due to a series of events that would come to be called fate, the match didn't happen. Miyata broke his fists in the fight preceding his match with Ippo and took three months off to recover. During that interval, Randy Boy Junior became the Interim Champion. Miyata then cancelled his match with Ippo, much to everyone's confusion."
Mashiba, Ryo;Ryo Mashiba (間柴 了);"Ryo ""Shinigami, The Executioner"" Mashiba";"
Mashiba Ryo is a fictional character from the anime and manga series Hajime No Ippo, and Fighting Spirit . He is one of the darker characters in the series, but has shown his lighter and good natured side from time to time. He lives with his sister, Kumi Mashiba, whom he is very protective of. Their parents are deceased, having died in an accident when Mashiba was in school. He is well known for his hitman style of boxing that utilizes one of his specialties, the flicker jab; both of which appear to be modeled after Thomas Hearns. His other specialty is a close range chopping right."
Date, Eiji;Eiji Date (伊達 英二);Eiji  Date;"
At an age swiftly approaching thirty, Date is an old-timer for a boxer, but is nevertheless the man that Ippo looks up to. Years ago, he lost his World Title Match to the champion, Ricardo Martinez, who was defending his title for the 2nd time. He was knocked out in the 2nd round, and among other injuries, got a scar on the bridge of his then-fractured nose.

Date gave up boxing after that in order to settle down with his wife Aiko (a woman from a rich family who sacrificed a lot to be with him, and who just had a miscarriage at that time) and raise a family. But Date was a born boxer—he found he could not contain his combative nature for long, and after Aiko told him that she wanted their son Yuuji to see his dad fight, he picked his career back up to the top. Date is strong in every way, but his greatest weapon is the Heartbreak Shot, a corkscrew blow to the heart that immobilizes the opponent.


He is the first boxer to have defeated Ippo in the ring, making Kamogawa throw the towel. After this fateful match, Date went after the WBA title—a rematch with Ricardo Martinez, who was making his 18th title defense—but lost by K.O. in the 10th round. The injuries he received in this fight included broken hands and a fractured jaw, and seriously limited Date's chances of making a return to the ring. He has, however, passed on his dream to Ippo. Currently, he trains other boxers at the Nakadai Gym. Morikawa Jouji stated in an interview that Date was modeled after former OPBF Champion Ozaki Fujio. At the time of his retirement, Date held a record of 23-2-0 with 17 KO's. He was the former OPBF Featherweight Champion as well as a two-time JBC Featherweight Champion and has twice been the #1 contender to Ricardo Martinez's WBA Featherweight Title.

He comes from Wales, a country unknown to most in the book, where his family still remain unaware of his activities in Sophie's world or of its existence.

Despite his reputation, Howl is in reality an endearing, charming man who is intelligent and considerate, if somewhat self-appreciative and stubborn at times. He enjoys ""slithering out"" of uncomfortable situations, often in comical ways.

Howl is described as being tall and suave, fond of dyeing his hair and wearing impressive suits. However, he is described by Calcifer as ""very vain for a plain man with mud-coloured hair."""

Partner(s): Genos

Saitama is the most powerful hero alive. Having apparently trained himself to superhuman condition, Saitama faces an existential crisis as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from his heroic deeds.

He is registered with the Heroes Association as a C-Class Superhero and is tasked to defend Z-City against Mysterious Beings.

Saitama is usually deliberately drawn in a simpler style than other characters, with a very rounded head and only a simple mouth and eyes. When drawn in a more 'action-oriented' style with more detail, Saitama is revealed to have sharp features, dangerous looking eyes, and chiseled musculature. His costume is a plain yellow jumpsuit with a short zipper at the collar and a belt. The costume is finished out by an ensemble of red boots and gloves, and a white cape.

For a superhero, Saitama is rather laid back. Because even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, he doesn't take his hero work very seriously. In spite of this, he is constantly searching for an opponent that can challenge him, since his superhero work is beginning to bore him because it's too easy. The combination of his attitude, unstoppable strength, and distinctively simple and 'unimpressive' appearance often cause his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms before suddenly and nonchalantly obliterating them with one punch.

His face is covered with crack-shaped markings that start from his eye(and cover most of his body presumably).

When the armour is broken by Saitama's punch, he attains a more intimidating and slightly more muscular build, while his skin darkens in colour, parts of his body grow scales and spikes, and his markings start emitting energy, and gain a lighter colour. In his Meteoric Burst form, his appearance changes drastically. His hair grow reaching his back, his eye's sclera becomes black, and his body becomes engulfed in energy, while his markings now return to their original, dark colour.

Personality: Thanks to his amazing powers, Boros is both arrogant and prideful. Due to his love of battles and inability to find any opponent who has been able to match him in power, he roams the universe looking for worthy opponents that would be stand against him. He met a prophet that revealed to him that in a far off planet he would finally find a strong opponent that would be able to fight on par with him, giving Boros the enjoyable fight he had always desired.

She is capable of manipulating the properties of the environment and any materials within it at any scale to her desire, referred to as ""bogus magic"" by Kyon. For instance, she can create a baseball bat that only hits home runs, nullify data links (removing other artificial interface connections from their bodies), plus she is able to make a cover up story (since Ryoko was gone, she made a cover up story that she moved to Canada), and reconstruct a classroom, down to the last detail, after everything in it was completely destroyed. As a result, she is capable of feats of superhuman strength, agility, and stamina. In one instance, she was unfazed while impaled by multiple metal spikes, and effortlessly reconstructed her body afterwards. Her state also affords her an extreme level of intelligence. She can comprehend the rules and concepts of a game instantaneously, as well as create flawless strategies based on her observations, and was able to learn how to play a guitar mere moments after receiving one. Yuki has a very stoic and introverted personality, preferring simple body language rather than speaking. When prompted to speak, she does so in a very concise manner, always speaking in a monotone and displaying a dispassionate complexion. She thinks very rationally, and finds it difficult to communicate with normal humans due to her intelligence and lack of empathy. She enjoys reading, and is seen reading a book in the majority of her appearances. As the series continues, she develops a sense of humor, although her unchanging facial expressions make it near-impossible to discern whether she is joking or not. Despite her reserved manner, she is reliable and trustworthy, resulting in Kyon trusting her more than other members of the SOS Brigade. Yuki is described by Haruhi as the SOS Brigade's ""indispensable silent character."" She was neither recruited by nor did she join the Brigade but was actually included along with the room when Haruhi arrived and declared it as her own. Whenever she is in the club room, she is usually reading. Similar to Itsuki Koizumi, Yuki is obedient when orders are given; however, her loyalties lie more with Kyon rather than Haruhi. The other members often rely on Yuki and her abilities whenever needed most, notably when the SOS Brigade was losing in the baseball tournament, the contest against the Computer Society, and in the case of the Cave Cricket. Aside from this role, she is also responsible for Kyon's safety, as evident when she saved him from an attack by Ryōko, since Kyon's presence stabilizes Haruhi's emotions. In the SOS Brigade's amateur movie production The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina, Yuki was cast as the leading antagonist. She was portrayed as an alien, who could also use magic. Kyon also realized after the ""cave cricket"" incident that Yuki plays a ""behind the scenes"" role, making her one of the puppeteers whose goals are to ensure Haruhi is fully satisfied and that order and balance are maintained. Her intentions of being in the Brigade are to monitor Haruhi and prevent her from feeling bored or greatly disappointed because it is generally believed by the Integrated Data Entity that a drastic event that could end the universe would occur. It is also believed that Haruhi is also the key to evolution and thus it is important for Yuki and other humanoid interfaces to continue their observations. She also has the ability to detect any spatial changes in the environment caused by Haruhi and will act to prevent them from persisting. An example of this is during the unscripted attack in the first fight scene of the Brigade movie, when she tackled Mikuru in order to remove her contact lens which had temporarily caused the fictional ""Mikuru Beam"" to become real."
Suzumiya, Haruhi;Haruhi Suzumiya (涼宮 ハルヒ);Haruhi  Suzumiya;"
Age: 16-17
Birthday: October 8
Height: 158 cm (5'2"")
Blood type: AB
Occupation: Student (grade 10-11), Ultra Director, Ultra Detective, Brigade Chief and Founder

Background
Haruhi Suzumiya, a first year student at North High School (in novels 1-8), and second year (in the 9th and latest novel), can be characterized as funny, eccentric, and somewhat unpredictable. In the series, she is introduced declaring her interests in aliens, espers and time travelers and does not care for ""ordinary"" human beings. The last thing on her mind is a normal high school life. With a burning desire to find such phenomena in the world, she is generally unapproachable and finds ordinary people boring and uninteresting. As a result of this, many of her classmates choose to avoid and confront her. She deals with her emotions by creating a parallel universe, where she inadvertently releases transparent creatures who tear up and destroy everything that comes into contact with them. Espers are the ones who can stop these creatures by cutting and destroying them, because if these creatures are left alone destroying everything as well as the outer barrier it could affect the outside world. She also likes to dress up Mikuru in random outfits.

Kyon is the first character to engage with her in a serious conversation. From this encounter, she gradually begins to soften up to others and starts to open up with her classmates. Later on, Haruhi took Kyon against his will and forced him to help her start the SOS Brigade, thus she has taken an unknown interests to Kyon later in the series. It is hinted that one of the reasons as to why Haruhi opened up to Kyon was that he resembled John Smith; John Smith and Kyon are the same person.

She is noted as smart, athletic, and naturally talented in any extra-curricular activities. She once joined every activity club in her school and quit because she found them boring, despite pleas by the club members for her membership. Her musical talent was highlighted when she stood in as the emergency lead singer and guitarist, along with Yuki, for the band ENOZ during the school festival.


Her childhood is cited as an originator for her interests in strange phenomena. While attending a baseball game with her family, she was shocked to see the vast number of people who had come to see the game. Before then, she had often thought of herself and her life as being special and interesting, yet then came to realize that they were just ordinary normal occurrences and habits and that she is just one of many living human in all of Japan in which Japan is just part of Earth. Consequently, she believed then that there must be at least one person in the world who is living an interesting and truly unique life and sought out to effectively be that person thus motivating her to seek out the extraordinary. After this realization she became notorious in middle school for doing odd things which included painting strange hieroglyphs all over the school grounds using a field marker and placing all the school desks in the halls. Additionally, she accepted and rejected every guy who had ever asked her out, the longest lasting a week and the shortest being five minutes. She only seeks relationships with aliens, espers, and time travelers. This shows the depth of her interest in finding non-humans and strange phenomena.

In actuality, Haruhi is believed to be either a crack in the space-time continuum, the first technological singularity to be spontaneously born in the universe, or some sort of deity, depending on point of view. This belief stems from a massive spontaneous universal event that occurred three years prior to Haruhi meeting Kyon, of which Haruhi is said to be the cause. The event attracted the attention of three prominent groups: the Extraterrestrial Integrated Data Entity, time travelers from a distant future, and a group of espers known as the ""Agency."" Her powers which are capable of altering, creating, or destroying reality are triggered by her emotions and inner desires. It's been theorized by the espers that the current universe may be just one in a string that Haruhi had subconsciously created. In order to relieve stress whenever she becomes too emotionally unstable, patches of alternate dimension referred to as ""closed space"" are created and within resides gigantic blue entities that destroy the surrounding area. Despite having these powers Haruhi is completely oblivious to them or the existence of aliens, time travelers, and espers.
Personality
At first, Haruhi seems very indifferent and cold but underneath that front she is very spontaneous, upbeat, and hyperactive. Her determination, persistence, and resourcefulness drive her endeavors of finding strange phenomenon and promoting the SOS Brigade. Because of her dedication, she becomes hot-headed when things don't go her way. Hand-in-hand with her cleverness and creativity, and a certain ruthlessness, even seeming amorality, she can often get what she wants, an example of such is when she blackmailed the Computer Society President into giving her a brand new computer for the SOS Brigade. Haruhi tends to pursue her goals regardless of who gets in the way, or is hurt, such as Mikuru in the aforementioned blackmail. She also has a tendency to be jealous and angry when Kyon gets too friendly with any girl. Evidently, the universe was almost destroyed and recreated when Haruhi's jealousy was pushed too far.

Haruhi also has a very competitive personality and accepts without hesitation any challenge that crosses her, regardless of difficulty or time constraint. Her constant optimism and over-confidence make her seem arrogant. She has very high standards and won't accept anything less than perfection from herself and her Brigade. She places a lot of trust in her Brigade members, especially Kyon, to get the task done whatever it may be. This can sometimes make her seem selfish and unkind.

She is not shy and often attracts a lot of attention to the point of not minding changing clothes in front of various people, more so when her SOS Brigade is in mind. When it comes to Mikuru she is very physically playful. She often comments on Mikuru's attractiveness and seems to find a kind of enjoyment in exploiting it to her own ends, often through forcing Mikuru into and out of various costumes such as a bunny girl costume as if she were a human dress-up doll.


Haruhi also seems to hate showing signs of vulnerability to others. Following her concert performance at the school's culture festival when she and Yuki filled in for two members of the band ENOZ, Haruhi showed awkwardness toward the band members when they thanked her the following day. As Kyon pointed out, Haruhi was not used to receiving praise from others because of how mischievous she regularly acts toward others because of her abnormal interests. Though many of Haruhi's efforts are devoted to finding supernatural beings, she does not actually believe in them. This is suggested by Itsuki during the first light novel, that Haruhi does not force himself, Yuki, or Mikuru to reveal themselves because her commonsense will not let her believe that they exist. In fact, between the first and second light novels, when Kyon tries to convince Haruhi that the other SOS Brigade members are more than they appear, she does not believe him. Later, she bases The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina on Kyon's story.

SOS Brigade role
Haruhi is the founder and ""Brigade Chief"" of the SOS Brigade, or Saving The World by Overloading it with Fun Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade. She was unable to find any existing club suitable to her preferences. She made the group in order to find and have fun with aliens, espers, and time travelers. Upon creation, she names herself as its leader. Her method of finding and recruiting members is to ""voluntarily arrest"" them then force them to join.

The SOS Brigade is very precious to her and has stated to Kyon that she has no intention of yielding her position as Chief to anyone else. She will go to any lengths, even by exploiting the members, to bring attention and support for her Brigade such as procuring room and materials, maintaining their website, participating in sports tournaments, organizing activities such as city-wide searches for strange phenomenon among other things. She wrote, produced, and directed the Brigade's amateur-movie The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina for the school festival.


However, unbeknownst to her is the true purpose of the SOS Brigade: to prevent Haruhi from becoming bored, as her boredom would bring about the end of the world as the SOS Brigade's members know it. Kyon also happens to be a very important person in her life. For whatever reason, Haruhi ""chose"" Kyon. This is first said by Yuki, then restated by Mikuru, and Itsuki as well. She often relies on and trusts Kyon with anything. Kyon is the only person whom she has been open with, and when she briefly created a ""new world,"" he was the only person she had brought over from the ""old world."" These are all made evident in the fourth novel The Vanishment of Haruhi Suzumiya, where she remained at Kyon's side for the three days he was in a coma due to a small accident; however, he is apparently worth far more to her than even she realizes. Unknown to her, the person she knew as John Smith, who ""helped"" her draw weird symbols at the schoolyard of East Junior High (her old school) at night on Tanabata three years prior, is in fact, Kyon from the present time, sent back in time. Furthermore, his time there unintentionally created an alternate timeline where no SOS Brigade existed, Yuki, Mikuru, Ryoko, Itsuki, and Haruhi were normal humans and the latter two never transferred to North High, thus no SOS Brigade. Only by going back to that night again was Kyon able to set things right. Finally, should Kyon reveal to Haruhi that he is John Smith, it would radically change everything, as he stated to the Integrated Data Entity through Yuki."
Asahina, Mikuru;Mikuru Asahina (朝比奈 みくる);Mikuru  Asahina;"
Age: Unknown (17-18 speculated only)
Height: 152 cm (5 ft)
Occupation: Student (grade 11-12), SOS Deputy Vice Commander

Mikuru Asahina, a shy and timid girl with a childish naïveté, is the only character other than Kyon to be brought into the SOS Brigade against her will. She is defined by Kyon to be extremely cute, and is often sexually harassed by Haruhi Suzumiya.


She is in fact a time traveller from the future with the purpose of observing Haruhi during the course of the story line.
Considered one of the most beautiful girls in high school Mikuru is as kind, caring and thoughtful as she is beautiful. She easily gets scared or flustered, and is apparently prone to daydreaming as she can also be rather clumsy at times. Nevertheless, she can be surprisingly resilient and is capable of recovering from even the most discomforting of situations. However, because of her gentle nature she seems rather helpless most of the time. Kyon sees it as his duty to always watch over and protect her, although, when it comes to Haruhi there is no rescue.

Mikuru is the designated ""mascot"" of the SOS Brigade, serving as a way to attract interest and members by using her attractive physical qualities—her cute face, trim figure, and noticeably sizable bust. She was ""voluntarily arrested"" by Haruhi, who deemed it necessary to have an alluring lolita type in the club. Her sex appeal and innocence is often exploited by Haruhi to procure resources. Mikuru is on a regular occasion forced to wear any outfits that Haruhi buys for her. Haruhi also sees it fit that Mikuru is unable to dress and undress by herself most times and often does it for her, much to Mikuru's considerable—and vocal—distress. So far, Mikuru has worn the following outfits: maid, waitress, nurse, frog costume, cheerleader, miko, and the infamous bunny-girl.

The name ""Mikuru (みくる)"" is derived from ""Miku"" which when written in Kanji is ""Mirai (未来)"" (""future"" in Japanese)."
Koizumi, Itsuki;Itsuki Koizumi (古泉 一樹);Itsuki  Koizumi;"
Age: 16-17
Height: 178 cm (5' 10"")
Occupation: Student (grade 11), Vice Commander

Itsuki is the last member to have joined the SOS Brigade, having been recruited by Haruhi as a ""mysterious transfer student.""


Itsuki was sent to observe and keep Haruhi emotionally stable, in order to protect the rest of humanity. Although he is an esper, which is exactly one of the sorts of people Haruhi desires to meet, Itsuki never reveals himself as such, at least, not to her.
Itsuki is constantly smiling and always speaks in a formal and polite manner. He is also prone to giving long and detailed explanations, usually illustrated by exaggerated hand gestures. Itsuki has confirmed to Kyon once that his outer personality is merely an artificial image he fakes in accordance to Haruhi's impression of him, and hints that his true character is something quite different, being ""less pleasing"" in the eyes of others. Maintaining his casual, constantly smiling self, however, is vital for keeping Haruhi's mentality balanced.

Out of the three Brigade members, Kyon is the least fond of Itsuki. He often finds himself annoyed with Itsuki's plastic smile, his willingness to acquiesce to Haruhi's outrageous schemes, playful teasing and his various forays into his psychological and philosophical theories (e.g., omphalos hypothesis, Anthropic principle, etc.). He is also distrustful of Itsuki's intentions, comparing him to Yuki Nagato when it comes to deciphering his expressions. Itsuki's fondness for speculation often causes him to produce explanations for situations involving the SOS Brigade, its members and related events. Ironically, Itsuki can only share his theories with Kyon and also enthusiastically plays different kinds of board games with him to pass the time, despite losing all the time, although Kyon suspects that he may be doing so on purpose.


Despite the theory he advances in which Haruhi is the equivalent of God, Itsuki says that there are many differing lines of speculation about Haruhi within ""The Agency."" Itsuki himself does not believe in a singular God, nor does he regard Haruhi as such, although he reveals that he has colleagues that do. Apparently, most of the questions that he raises about Haruhi's true nature are philosophical in nature and do not necessarily represent his personal beliefs. Itsuki also reveals that the majority of ""The Agency"" advocates observing Haruhi instead of doing anything that might provoke her.

In the Disappearance arc, the altered Koizumi reveals that he has a crush on Haruhi. This does not necessarily mean that the real Koizumi harbors such feelings, but it is possible that he would have feelings for her if Kyon would not be Haruhi's love interest.

In the Astonishment arc, Koizumi is revealed to be the leader and founder of the Agency. Furthermore, he reveals part of his true personality when he blows up at the aliens and time travelers for meddling. More or less, he threatens war against both factions should they continuing tampering with Haruhi. Koizumi also says that he is a part of Haruhi's subconscious made physical, although he never explains what he means more fully. He seems especially suspicious of the time travelers, particularly Asahina (Adult)."
Tsuruya; Tsuruya (鶴屋);" ""Tsuru-chan"" Tsuruya";"
Tsuruya is the hyperactive friend of Mikuru (from the current time plane) notable for her loud voice, ankle-length hair, and prominent tooth. She possesses a cheerful and friendly disposition. She is also prone to long fits of unrestrained and intense laughter at things she considers even the slightest bit humorous.

Her fang-like tooth gives her an idiosyncratic speech pattern, causing her to misspeak words by leaving out syllables, as seen in episode 9. Her speech pattern is often accompanied with a lisp and her catch phrases ""megas"" and ""nyoro."" Her knowledge of the SOS Brigade comes almost exclusively from Mikuru. She is also the heir of the Tsuruya family, which purportedly collaborates with Itsuki's Agency. It is also unknown if Tsuruya has a secret identity or agenda.

Though not an actual member of the SOS Brigade, she does play a minor role in Mikuru Asahina's Adventure - Episode 00 and serves on their baseball team in episode four. She also has a small appearance in the ninth and twelfth episodes of the anime, but otherwise appears relatively sparingly throughout the anime. She appears a few more times during the novels, appearing more prominently than in the anime's rendition of the same stories, and even getting along very well with Haruhi. Kyon believes this is because both Haruhi and Tsuruya are nearly insane. Though she is not a brigade member, Tsuruya is still used as an extra body for some of the Brigade's activities.


In the light novels, it is strongly implied that Tsuruya's wealthy and venerable family is a covert supporter of ""the Agency"" to which Itsuki Koizumi belongs. Tsuruya herself seems to possess some knowledge of the secrets of the SOS Brigade and other matters, although she never explicitly says so. Tsuruya temporarily takes care of Mikuru Asahina during an event when the latter has a double presence in the ""present"" of the SOS Brigade and is also the caretaker of a mysterious artifact discovered on her family's grounds, both at Kyon's request.

In the original light novel The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, Tsuruya's role in the altered reality is that of Mikuru Asahina's best friend. She is shown to be extremely protective of her, even resorting to violence to keep her safe, but still maintains her cheerful disposition."
Asakura, Ryouko;Ryouko Asakura (朝倉 涼子);Ryouko  Asakura;"
At first, Ryouko appears to be a compassionate and hard-working high school girl. One of Kyon's friends, Taniguchi, places her in the top three first-year girls in the school with a grade of AA+: indicative of her pleasant personality, beauty, and athleticism. Her enormous popularity made her the unanimous choice for class president of Kyon's homeroom class. She also showed particular concern about how Haruhi had distanced herself from the rest of the class.


However, it turns out that she is Yuki's backup, and as such, is also another ""humanoid interface."" Much like Yuki, she finds it difficult to empathize with humans, but unlike Yuki, possesses exceptional social skills. Initially she cheerfully supports Kyon's reaching out to Haruhi, often encouraging him to ""open her up to the class,"" making Haruhi easier to observe. However, she later decides to try and kill Kyon with a combat knife in the hopes of catalyzing an observable reaction from Haruhi. Her efforts are stopped, after Yuki defeated and removed her from the physical world. It's interesting to note that her cheerful personality doesn't falter, even at the moment of her own demise. Afterwards, Yuki fabricated a cover story that she moved to Canada. Ryouko makes a reappearance in the Disappearance arc, on an alternate timeline in which Haruhi never attends North High or forms an SOS Brigade. In this timeline she is just a normal human and is very kind to the shy Nagato; however, this Ryoko's timeline is obssesed with her; when she seemingly sees Kyon trying to shoot Nagato with a gun, she stabs him with a knife, believing that this is what Yuki wanted, it was briefly shown that Ryoko may show feelings for Nagato and would do anything to protect her. In the Astonishment arc, Ryouko takes her rightful place as Nagato's backup since Nagato became ill. While she still wishes to kill Kyon (and even goes to far as to tell him this with a smile on her face), she ironically saves him twice from Kuyou. Kyon made the decision that she should not enroll at North High again (as he doesn't want to provoke Haruhi) which she agrees to. Ryouko is currently unable to attack Kyon because Emiri was given special counter-measures against Ryouko's attacks. Because of this, Ryouko is actually a bit of an ally to Kyon at this point."
Kyon's Sister;Kyon's Sister  (キョンの妹);"Kyon's Sister ""Kyon no Imouto"" ";"
Not much is revealed about Kyon's fifth-grade sister; not even her real name is given. Other characters simply refer to the eleven-year-old as Kyon's (Younger) Sister or Little Sis. She has relatively few speaking lines, though she does appear in The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina - Episode 00, Episode 6, and Episode 14, fulfilling the duties of an irrepressible younger sister. She has even fewer lines and appearances in the original novel version than the anime's rendition. Usually, her presence is made apparent whenever Kyon is at home.

She is carefree, happy and playful and is also the force behind the use of the nickname ""Kyon""; after she heard their aunt call her older brother such, she started using the nickname as well in front of his school friends. From there, the name spread and eventually stuck. She seems to get along well with all of the SOS Brigade, especially with Mikuru, sharing a sister-like relationship with her.

Shamisen is a stray cat selected by Haruhi to play the role of Yuki's familiar for their film ""The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina"", Shamisen is unusual in the sense that he is a male calico cat. During the filming of the movie, Haruhi's reality-altering powers temporarily give Shamisen the ability to speak. He is adopted by Kyon after the completion of the movie, and is given the nickname ""Shami"" by his sister."

Taniguchi is comically lascivious; he gave a 'score' of attractiveness to each first-year girl based upon his tastes and preferences.

As for Mikuru, her mere presence elicits an altered state of adoration for Taniguchi and Kunikida, especially when she was in her soba-serving costume. He also knew Haruhi from back in junior high, and was Kyon's original source of information on Haruhi before he started conversing with her. It is hinted that he may have been the person that dated Haruhi for the shortest amount of time.

Natsume, Takashi;Takashi Natsume (夏目貴志);Takashi  Natsume;"
Age: 15-16
Birthday: July 1 (Cancer)
Height: 167 cm
Blood Type: B

Natsume Takashi is the main protagonist of the series who, like his deceased grandmother Natsume Reiko, has the ability to see ayakashi (spirits). He inherited the Book of Friends from her, a book of contracts binding ayakashi to servitude when they were defeated by Reiko. Due to Natsume's strong resemblance to his grandmother, he is often mistaken for her and is pursued by ayakashi who hate Reiko but yearn for the Book of Friends. To rid himself of these troubles, Natsume resolved to end the book by returning all the contracted names to their former owners. He is accompanied by the youkai Madara, nicknamed ""Nyanko-sensei"" (or simply ""sensei""), promising him possession of the book once he dies. In return, the creature must serve as his bodyguard until then.

Orphaned at an early age, Natsume was passed on from relative to relative. His ability to see and communicate with ayakashi isolated him from both family and friends throughout his childhood. He was labeled as a 'liar' and 'attention seeker' for trying to tell others about the ayakashi, and his attempts to run away from the youkai had them calling him insane. Natsume then became reclusive in order to try to lead a relatively “normal” life with people. Eventually, he was passed on to the Fujiwaras, a middle-aged couple from his father's side of the family. In contrast to the relatives before, they genuinely care for Natsume, and he loves them in return. He does not want to cause them any trouble, so the ayakashi problem remains secret.

Natsume's incredibly strong spiritual power allows him to actually hit and hurt youkai. He develops friendships with youkai and exorcists alike, though the interest of many is to use him to their advantage. In the anime, Natsume is more cheery and good-natured, while in the manga, he is slightly more dismal and short-tempered, especially toward Nyanko-sensei.

To return the names inscribed in the Book of Friends, Natsume must first picture the said ayakashi in his mind to learn of its name. The book then flips open to the page where the name is written, which he takes out and places in his mouth while breathing out. The spell which originally enslaved the spirits used Reiko's saliva and breath; as Reiko's grandson and one who bears a strong resemblance to Reiko, Natsume is able to use the spell as well. The cost of releasing each name, however, is that his energy is almost completely drained in the process."
Madara;Madara  (斑);"Madara ""Sensei, Nyanko, Nyangoro, Nyankichi, Ponta, Nyanta, Nyan-Nyan"" ";"
Madara was sealed in a shrine until he was accidentally released by Natsume. Because Madara was trapped in a material form for so long, Madara ordinary takes on the shape of a maneki neko (lucky cat), leading Natsume to nickname him Nyanko-sensei. In this form, other people can see him, leading for Natsume having to ask his guardians if he could keep him as a pet.

Madara is a powerful spirit, who protects Natsume from others and teaches him spells on occasion, in return for Natsume's promise to give him the Book of Friends when he dies. They often fight each other, which leads to Natsume punching Madara on the face and knocking him out. Despite his protests of not being a cat, he likes to play with cat toys. Nyanko's design is based on a lucky cat statue Midorikawa was given as a child. In the anime, Natsume is more respectful to Madara."
Natsume, Reiko;Reiko Natsume (夏目 レイコ);Reiko  Natsume;"
Takashi Natsume's grandmother, from whom he inherited the ability to see yokai. Reiko had high spiritual energy, which gave her the ability to see and seal yokai.

Reiko was always shunned and even got rocks thrown at her for being able to see yokai. That is why she created the Book of Friends, Reiko was lonely and wanted friends. Since she believed no human could ever understand her, she turned to the spirits for companionship. Reiko was extraordinarily powerful, and so she bullied spirits into obeying her by playing games with them. If they lost, she would make them give her their names. Reiko gathered the names into the Book of Friends, this gave her the ability to summon whichever yokai she had the name of. A necessary part of the sealing was her saliva and breath. Madara mentions that she had sloppy table manners and was very forgetful.

Reiko died when she was young, so no one remembered her."

Cold hearted and rational. He uses ayakashi as bait to exorcise other ones and wants stronger ones to protect humans (although he doesn't mind hurting humans too when they're in his way). Ayakashis are just replaceable tools for him. He mainly uses a bow and arrow against them and if he finds their sealing troublesome, he prefers eliminating them. In the past one of the Matoba clan offered his right eye to an ayakashi for assistance, but in the end he never gave it. Ever since than the heads of the clan has had their right eye targetted by that ayakashi. Matoba Seiji still has his eye, but (according to his words) has a horrible scar."

Tohru Taki is a female student at Natsume's school. She was first ""discovered"" by one of Natsume's friends, Nishimura who had heard rumors of her beauty and became entranced, he still maintains an obvious crush on her even though Natsume holds most of her attention.

Taki is introduced into the story as a shy, silent girl. Later, the reason for this is because she was cursed by a yokai; the last 13 names said by her will be eaten by him at the end of a one year period. The yokai also throws her into an impossible gamble for her life which he does not honor even when she wins.

Taki is generally a happy, extroverted and optimistic girl. She is shown to have a peculiar taste in cuteness, as is shown when she hugs Nyanko-sensei, calling him cute. Like Tanuma, she tries to help Natsume in any way she can, but is usually prevented from doing so because Natsume worries about their involvement with yokai.

Even though Taki herself has too little spirit energy to see yokai, she does have the knowledge of drawing yokai circles, discovered by her grandfather. The circle, once drawn, gives any human the ability to see yokai who step within the radius of the circle. The circle does not require any spirit energy to create and activate, so anyone could possible draw it if they know how to. But due to it being complicated in looks, Taki is presummably the only one able to draw it without the need of a guide."

He is currently a student at Tootsuki Culinary Academy and a resident of Polar Star Dormitory.

It is because the will of Souma to try to move forward, his dishes are often considered as creative and innovative by some peers and lecturers; leading his rivalry with all the students in the Tootsuki Culinary Academy. Through all this, Souma maintains a laid back attitude towards just about everything but cooking.

Souma can cook many different foods in many different styles, though he prefers what he calls ""Yukihira Style,"" which is the cooking style which he learned from his father. Souma shows an immense capability for cooking and a special adaption with learning from his mistakes, and improvising through learning from said mistakes. It is due to his creativity and also resourcefulness, Souma is able to create the same dishes with different ways of cooking that would create even. Unlike most student whom used lavish ingredients, Souma didn't care about the classes of the ingredients which he claimed that it wasn't expensive ingredients, classy backgrounds, nor fancy techniques made the food better, but rather it's the wise usage and alternatives made the food interesting, and the customer's satisfaction about the food that matters. Further more, he also claimed that undefeated food in just the looks and taste in regal made him bored, which the boredom would made the chef stop improving their dishes. To eliminate such boredom, Souma continued to search for different styles of cooking around the world in order to improve his cooking skills."
Nakiri, Erina;Erina Nakiri (薙切 えりな);"Erina ""God's Tongue"" Nakiri";"
Age: 15–16
Cuisine style: Regal Themed Dishes
Occupation: High School Student
Affiliation: Tootsuki Culinary Academy, Elite Ten Council: 10th seat

Due to her background as one of the prestige family of high-class Japanese food chain industry, the Tootsuki Corporation, Erina often looks down upon whoever is considered as ""common"" and unjust to her taste due to her family's high pedigree. Having a fearsome reputation for her ""God's Tongue"" to taste the food flavor accurate, Erina is able to disqualify anyone whose the dish taste ""bad"" and her foul critic could break the chef (and student alike) soul of tenacity. She is also one of the Elite 10 in Tootsuki Culinary Academy and uses her position to judge a student dish based on their family background and status.

Born in the prestige and influential family with affluent finances and refined pedigree, Erina is one of the arrogant, prideful and pampered students in Tootsuki Culinary Academy. Typical wealthy family's princess from her high famed family background, she looks down on people (particularly Souma) or society which doesn't share her lifestyle and only socialize with the group of people which have an abundance wealth and strong influences. Having a reputation known as ""God's Tongue"" for an ability to taste the food accurately and excel cooking skills, Erina is very serious upon the regal cooking style and classy ingredients, in which can't be tolerated if any failures or distaste within' the food, even the slightest could make a very big deal about it. According to the living legend, ""Doujima Gin,"" her tongue was so special that she can taste 8 different salts blindfolded. Due to her reputation, she is both inspired and feared by many newcomers within the academy (except Souma), even the academy lecturers and her ""senpai"" found her narcissistic ego was so overwhelming that she is too stubborn to listens to almost anyone. Other than that, Erina is also picky about food to which she rather picks high-class cuisine instead of daily dishes, and claimed that normal food doesn't match her taste. Erina is also sadistic to which she often relish on people suffering and reluctance over her offer as her amusement, while she is also narcissistic that only she is better than anyone in the academy (except Souma who found that she is actually dishonest to herself and even claimed her dish boring due to her ego.).

Despite all of her narcissistic, arrogant and stubborn mannerism, Erina is also shown to be a ""tsundere"" student who denied almost everything even after all there are something good about it, particularly Souma which his food tasted so good that even her god tongue couldn't help but be impressed over his style. Likewise, despite her attempts to remain aloof and regal in her interactions with Souma, she is shown to be easily flustered by Souma's casual and laid back attitude due to her overrated ego and often ends up in comical embarrassment whenever Souma ignores her insults. Some situation said that Erina's imagination played an important yet ridiculous role which depends on her mood, any odd imagination she had would affect the student's result, usually the bad way. Erina also not a student who, because of her ego, admit her mistakes and her narcissistic behavior almost made her blinded and even phobia on mistakes (she may enjoy a sadistic pleasure to make her rival suffers, yet she is displeased whoever ""mock"" her or her weakness is found by certain figures). Even there is a slightest critique about her food (Souma is, in fact, the only student fearlessly point her weakness) would make her throw her tantrums, and often taking drastic measures just to cover her weakness.

Despite rarely participate in any Shokugeki, Erina's cooking style is believed to be the finest and elegant of all. Using all of every stylish style from the wealthy and high pedigree status of culinary, she referred the lavish ingredient to make the finest dish of all and suggested that only the high grade dish considered as eatable for her standards. It is also noted by Doujima himself that her cooking skills cannot be underestimated due to her quick skills along with her nickname ""God's Tongue,"" by managing to create the dish that matched her taste before completing the dish. It is also claimed that she can cook as fast as Souma, which made her one of the proficient rivals to Souma's style even though she rarely cooks (she is prideful of her skills though)."
Tadokoro, Megumi;Megumi Tadokoro (田所 恵);Megumi  Tadokoro;"
She is one of the main heroines who comes from a small port town in Japan. Megumi went to Tootsuki Culinary Academy to become a chef and make her family proud. Unfortunately, even with her neat skills in cooking, Megumi's poor social skills and her extreme demophobia got the best of her and had to relied on someone who is closed to her possibly due to her humble status and her ordinary beginnings in the academy. However, after witnessing Souma's incredible cooking skills and creative method of cooking, Megumi would become his assist partner and friend throughout the series.

Easily nervous and sensitive, Megumi is one of the clumsy and shy students who try to do her best while keeping her best to becoming a chef. She easily panics whenever accidents (some are usually in a comedic fashion) happen or when other students almost finish their work. She is also a rather cautious student who uses her words carefully to avoid unwanted consequences. It is revealed later that Megumi actually fears the crowd, which the crowd made her nervous even until the extent of her lacking confidence, might be the reason for her to be having barely survived passing in the academy, even with her actually good skills in cooking. With her demophobia, Megumi's skills were remained hindered despite her knowledge of recipe and some cooking methods.

Despite her weakness, Megumi is an honest and innocent student who does not lie about anything. She has a strong determination, and will try her best to reach her dream to become a chef after she paired with Souma. She also values friendship and rather observe towards any cooking style available in order for her to learn the style fast (especially Souma's).

Megumi's style of cooking is mostly based on cutting the ingredients using neat style. With her neat style of cutting, most of her cuts are considered as artistic as well as well prepared. Due to her fear of crowds, the true nature of her cooking are often hindered. Megumi's careful cutting and wise using of every materials made her as some of the unexpected expert, even if it took more weeks for her to specify the chemistry of the ingredients for the dish. Also, despite her lack of confidence and also her fear of crowds, Megumi's strong observation made her to create a dish to even supposed rivaled to Souma and other professional should she stay optimistic. With her being an assist chef beside Souma since her seemly last class at Chapple class, Megumi seemly adopted Souma's creativity through her observation from Souma's cooking."
Nakiri, Alice;Alice Nakiri (薙切 アリス);Alice  Nakiri;"
Nakiri Alice is a highly skilled chef that is currently attending Tootsuki Culinary Academy as a member of the Nakiri family. Ever since her cousin Erina told Alice her cooking was terrible when they were children, Alice's goal has been to become a top class chef and surpass Erina and her God Tongue. Before moving back to Japan to attend Tootsuki, she lived in Denmark with her family and began her focus on molecular gastronomy. As a result, her cooking is based on combining modern tools with the most advanced theories in order to deliver the best dishes she possibly can.

Alice has short silver hair with a left bang that is longer than the rest of her hair. She has fair skin and red eyes and tends to wear the beige Tootsuki vest uniform instead of the standard school uniform, and her cooking uniform is a short-sleeved chef's uniform with red accents on her cuffs and collar.

Alice has a very demanding personality that seems to emphasize her Nakiri upbringing. She's bossy and pushy, and will do what it takes to get her way, utilizing not only her personality but also her incredibly advanced cunning and wit. As a result, she absolutely hates to lose; an example here is the fact that—not wanting to be outdone by Erina— once she saw that Erina had an aid called Hisako Arato, she in turn forcefully made Kurokiba Ryo join her as an aid. When not competing, though, Alice is extremely friendly and talkative. She loves to prod and make fun of people during conversations, but will pout to no end when she wants or needs something or thinks something has happened to make her look worse."

Ginko;Ginko  (ギンコ);"Ginko ""Mushishi, Yoki"" ";"
Ginko employs himself as a Mushi master (mushishi), traveling from place to place to research Mushi and aid people suffering from problems caused by them.

Ginko is a rare person who attracts mushi. This inspires his peripatetic lifestyle; staying in one place too long will gather a potentially dangerous amount of mushi. He also smokes constantly in order to keep mushi away.

In terms of personality, Ginko is rather laid back, but can be very serious when it comes to protecting people from mushi. He also often stresses that the mushi are not evil, but they merely exist as a part of the nature and try to survive like every other living being.


When Nui found him, he was unconscious in the woods, wounded and abandoned. As he had no place to go, Nui decided to care for him instead of making him leave. He went by the name ""Yoki"" until Nui was consumed by the Ginko mushi. Yoki lost his memory and was forced to take a new name because of the nature of the Ginko mushi, thus changing his name in the only thing he remembers, ""Ginko""

Ginko's unusual white hair and green eye color is the result of an incident involving a mushi that occurred when he was a child.

He lost his other eye and hair color when he tried to save Nui from the Ginko mushi that lived in the pond near where they lived. Nui protected Ginko by telling him to offer them as a sacrifice so the Ginko would let him be. He never saw Nui again and after nearly being consumed by the mushi he adopted the name Ginko to save himself."

She appears to be an eight-year-old girl, but she was originally a beautiful vampire who had lived for more than 500 years. At the end of events of Koyomi Vamp, after Koyomi realizes that having saved his master from a certain death, leaded to a future where she will kill humans (the ""portable food"" she calls them) to ensure her survival, Koyomi revolts against Kissshot in a bloody battle to death, where Kissshot chooses not to use her full powers (in order to have a proper battle with her servant). Later on the battle it is revealed that she pretended to turn Koyomi into a human again, by letting herself be killed by Koyomi. After the shocking revelation, he cannot bring himself to kill his master who was giving her life for his, and who cared for him at the point of risking her life to save his (from sunburn) at the beginning of Spring's Break. But to prevent herself from eating more humans, Koyomi asked for help to Oshino Meme, who in the end tells that as a happy ending won't be possible for everyone, then everyone will have an unhappy ending! While Koyomi himself cannot return to be a fully human, Kissshot Acerolaorion Heartunderblade was left in a weakened condition (where she is no longer able to eat humans, and needs her servant's blood to survive) with no powers or traces of her original personality and therefore have to abandon her ""Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade"" (キスショット・アセロラオリオン・ハートアンダーブレード) name. Ever since ""Tsubasa Cat"" where she starts living in Araragi's shadow, she no longer needs to suck his blood on a regular basis in order to stay alive. She forms a physical connection with Araragi where they can feel each others emotions and senses. It is also later revealed that she can gain strength into an ""evolved"" form after sucking Araragi's blood more than the usual dosage, she does this in order to fight for Araragi when he confronts Yotsugi and Yozuru. In Mayoi Jiangshi, in the alternate timeline, Shinobu went berserk when Koyomi was killed by Black Hanekawa, feeling that she was somewhat responsible for his death, so she swore to destroy the world and created the Jiangshi that has been swarming the town. It seems that she truly cares about Koyomi and when she saw Koyomi was alive in the alternate timeline, she started weeping blood. In the end, Araragi simply states that he will die together with Shinobu. Her father named her Lola, however she went by the name Acerola.

Height: 165 cm
Weight: 55 kg

Koyomi Araragi is a third year high school student who survived a vampire attack during spring break and barely regained his human life in the time that followed as a boy with remnants of vampiric traits. He can see in the dark, his eyes turn red when he gets angry, and he heals incredibly fast. As a result, he questions his lifespan. He remains scared of morning sunlight despite the fact that it no longer has any negative effects on him.

Koyomi is a laid-back person whose only real friend at school is Tsubasa Hanekawa. He's a poor student, close to failing every class except math.

It is revealed through conversations that he's quite knowledgeable with anime; a fact even noted by Nadeko Sengoku once.

Although he is shown to be attracted to the other girls, he turns their advances down due to his loyalty to Hitagi.

Other characters seems to speculate that Koyomi is a lolicon, particularly Mayoi and Hitagi, with Hitagi thinking that Nadeko is a ""threat"" to her.

He is very noble, which is why Hitagi is attracted to him. He is willing to help others at the cost of his own life. As such, the female characters he has helped are quite attached to him. He feels most comfortable talking to Mayoi, Shinobu and, from the Second Season on, to Yotsugi about his problems.

Koyomi is the only person who thinks that his family relationship is bad, with Karen and Tsukihi thinking otherwise. His parents were revealed to be police officers.

His personality is portrayed more clearly in the novels, where his inner thoughts show him to be much more perverted and intelligent than the anime leads one to believe.

Due to events prior to
Kizumonogatari
and
Bakemonogatari
, Koyomi avoided having friends and seemed to have lost faith and trust in people and himself.

She is always seen dressed in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, even outside of school days, and is rarely seen on any other type of clothing, except for a set of sleepwear which she wore during Tsubasa Cat Arc.

Hanekawa Tsubasa is Araragi's classmate and the class president. Araragi describes her as ""the class president of all class presidents."" The reason Tsubasa and Hitagi cut their hair short is because they learned Araragi likes it short.

Hanekawa currently lives with her stepfather and stepmother.


Hanekawa Family's Past:

Her biological mother was 17 years old when she got pregnant, the biological father is unknown because she apparently had many lovers. Before she gave birth to Tsubasa, she married another man who was a ""workaholic."" Right after giving birth, Tsubasa's biological mother commited suicide. The workaholic stepfather, unable to raise a child, remarried again to a woman who is Tsubasa's current mother. The workaholic father soon died from overwork and the current mother married another man who is now Tsubasa's current father.

Hanekawa Story's overview in Nekomonogatari/Bakemonogatari:

Prior to the beginning of Bakemonogatari Hanekawa was possessed by a bakeneko (mischievous spirit of a dead cat) during Golden Week due to stress over her family (see Nekomonogatari: Kuro). The matter was eventually resolved with the help of Shinobu at the cost of some of Hanekawa's memories, but the problem emerged again right before the school festival because of different stress. Araragi was told by Hanekawa's bakeneko form that she has feelings for him. In ""Tsubasa Tiger"" (Nekomonogatari: Shiro), on her way to school, she met a tiger spirit which spoke to her. Soon buildings important to Hanekawa began to mysteriously burn down and ""Black Hanekawa"" (her bakeneko form) began to take over her body every time she slept. The inevitable showdown was afoot and led to some surprising events. ""Tsubasa Tiger"" is written from the perspective of Hanekawa rather than Araragi."

He and Takagi create manga for Shonen Jump under the pen-name Ashirogi Muto. Mashiro is very talented in drawing although he is very dissatisfied with his style. He specializes in drawing fairly dark characters. His favorite manga is Ashita no Joe.


After Ashirogi Muto's manga ""Reversi"" receives an anime adaptation and Azuki Miho secures the role of the main heroine, Mashiro properly proposes to Azuki in front of her old house which he had purchased for the two to live in.

Age: 15 (debut), 26 (end)
Birthdate: November 3, 1992

Eiji Nizuma is a high school genius mangaka who has been drawing ever since he was young. Moritaka Mashiro and Akito Takagi consider him their rival. He was supposed to serialize a manga called Yellow Hit but he wanted to draw a different manga, Crow, which appeared in Akamaru Jump instead. His assisants were initially Nakai and Fukuda (Mashiro also worked for him temporarily before Detective Trap was serialized). His editor is Hattori Yujiro. He once demanded to be allowed to end one series he hated if he ever made it as the most popular author in Jump.

Niizuma is slightly naive, but can also be serious and calculating when he wants to. Eiji tends to act conceited because he is hailed as a genius; however, after working on Crow for quite a long time, he grew more humble, even claiming to not be ""good enough of a Mangaka to be judging other people's work"" when asked by his editor to judge for the Golden Future Cup. (He judges anyway, but is not very helpful, only expressing his interest in Ashirogi and Ryu Shizuka). He tends to make noises and sound effects when drawing or writing his manga. Eiji is constantly chastised by his editor, and at first seems to be rather oblivious toward his rivals' feelings toward him, even expressing great excitement when he meets Ashirogi Muto and saying he is their fan. He is a great lover of manga and his opinion are valued by everyone at Jump, including his rivals. He refers to himself as an ""Eternal Boy"" and that is why he writes Shonen manga. He has only ever had a crush on one girl, back in elementary school, which paired with his naïveté most likely explains his lack of success in the Super Leaders' Love Fest."

Birthplace: Kanagawa-ken, Japan

Hiramaru was a salary man that hated working. On hearing Takagi and Mashiro talking about drawing manga on the subway and finding an abandoned copy of Jack, he quit his job to be a mangaka because he thought it would be less work for him. He is a different kind of genius compared to Eiji because he is talented even though he just started to write manga more in of a spur of the moment.

After teaching himself to draw manga in a very short amount of time, his manga, Otters 11 is serialized. He is hailed as a genius by Koji Yoshida who pushed for his serialization saying that Hiramaru had no real motivation to continue as a mangaka and failure would just make him quit.

Hiramaru is extremely lazy and immediately regrets getting serialized due to the amount of work to keep up a weekly series. He has said that he doesn't know why people have to work for a living and that he wants to sleep when he's tired and to eat when he's hungry. Due to his laziness, his editor, Koji Yoshida, often schemes to manipulate Hiramaru into working. Hiramura often tries to escape Yoshida to avoid working. His attempts to escape Yoshida is a long-running gag in the manga.

He is also a chronic hypochondriac and often makes incredible claims of illness. However, he is always proven healthy by the doctors. It's mostly believed that his ""illnesses"" are not only a product of his own fears, but also serves as an excuse to avoid work.

Hiramaru has a huge crush on Aoki Yuriko. Yoshida bribes him into doing work by giving him weekly facts about Aoki. Yoshida also often depicts dramatic scenarios of Aoki rejecting him due to his laziness or inability to produce names to energize him to work hard. Because he can't stand the idea of losing Aoki in his life, a combination of his own anxiety and Hiramaru's end-game scenarios, he works feverishly in hopes his work will earn Aoki's heart.


Eventually, he gets engaged to her in Chapter 160."

Fukuda is a main supporting character in Bakuman and the founder of Team Fukuda. He left home after high school and worked as an assistant to Eiji Niizuma for Crow, along with Mashiro. Fukuda had already won an honorable mention when he tried for the Tezuka Award and also got seventh place in the same issue of Akamaru Jump in which where Ashirogi's Money and Intelligence ran and got third place. Later, Fukuda competed with Ashirogi and Nakai in the Golden Future cup with his original manga, Kiyoshi Knight.

Later, Fukuda successfully serializes Kiyoshi Knight, quits his job as Niizuma's assistant, and gains a new assistant named Yasuoka. His editor is Yujiro. With the serialization of Kiyoshi Knight, Fukuda became an aspiring rival to Ashirogi, Eiji, and Nakai. Among these three, he is considered to have the worst drawings, though they apparently match his stories. His drawings often border on grotesque.

Fukuda is rash and often seems fueled by his emotional swings. He's very competitive, and enjoys the competition between him, Ashirogi, Eiji, and Nakai. Along with all of this, he's also rather conceited, but at the end of the day is a very good friend (and rival).


Despite the relative longevity of Kiyoshi Knight, Fukuda is unsatisfied with the series and concludes it, starting Road Racer GIRI to compete with his rivals. Road Racer GIRI gets off to a good start as soon as it is released, though Fukuda frequently remarks that he needs to get people who wouldn't ""draw such crappy bikes"". Fukuda's Road Racer GIRI ranks higher than Ashirogi's PCP on several occasions, maintaining a high ranking that is able to compete with and surpass Niizuma's +Natural. After the Love Fest, in which Fukuda is angry at placing second to last out of seven for his love manga, GIRI receives an anime offer, stunning Fukuda and causing him to gratefully thank Yujiro with formalities.

Hattori is often portrayed as one of the calmer and more calculated editors in the series. He comes across as a very wise and experienced editor which leaves him raising his voice only when he sees it absolutely necessary to do so. He is very fond of Takagi and Mashiro and continues to be interested in their progression as mangakas, offering off-hand advice to Miura when he can.

Aoki attended To-Oh University with Iwase, the same fictional and prestigious university that L and Light from Death Note attend together.


She currently works alone, both writing and drawing her stories without the help of a more talented artist, aside from her assistants. Hiramaru courts Aoki for a while, but the relationship becomes canon when he finally proposes to Aoki while on an amusement park's ferris wheel and she accepts."
Yoshida, Kouji;Kouji Yoshida (吉田幸司);Kouji  Yoshida;"
Age: 40 (currently)
Birthday: June 23, 1978

Yoshida is Hiramaru Kazuya's editor. He tells the chief-editor in the meeting about his genius, which led to Hiramaru's serialization. He is able to ignore Hiramaru's personality. He is also a Captain, meaning he gets to sit in the serialization meetings and lead the other editors in his team, like Yamahisa.

Yoshida is perhaps the most manipulative of the editors shown. When he realizes that forcing Hiramaru to work isn't applicable to an efficient and/or long-running series, he bribes him with rich items or information about Aoki Ko in order to get him back to work and pay off the debts he owes for buying such items. Yoshida is able to keep this running for an extended period of time (throughout the 200 chapters of Otters 11), even threatening Hiramaru with disassociation with Shueisha if he does not get serialized again after Otters 11 gets canceled.

Yoshida's reason and rationality are even more key to his character. He is able to deduce that Niizuma Eiji was responsible for +Natural's artwork and worries that Hiramaru's manga will take a dive if he asks Aoki Ko out and gets rejected, knowing that Hiramaru most probably will get rejected. This reasoning has its limits, however, as Yoshida was greatly surprised that Aoki accepted Hiramaru's proposal, though it would later scratch away most of Hiramaru's negativity and cause a dive in his manga quality."

L, who also uses the aliases Hideki Ryuga, Ryuzaki, Eraldo Coil and Deneuve, the latter two for which he has developed reputations as the second—and third—best detectives in the world, is quite secretive and only communicates with the world through his assistant Watari. He never shows his face to the world, instead representing himself with a capital L in Cloister Black font. After meeting the Kira investigation team, he requests that the task force refer to him as Ryuzaki for discretion. The Kira investigation team never learns his true name.

L's disheveled and languid appearance masks his great powers of deduction and insight. He tends to second-guess everything he is presented with, and is extremely meticulous and analytical. He has several quirks such as preferring to crouch rather than sit, eating only sweet foods like desserts and fruits, and holding items very delicately. He stayed in England for five years, and during that time he was the champion in tennis for the England Junior Cup.

L suggests that even though he eats only sweet foods, he remains underweight because the brain uses the most calories of any organ in the body. He also says that if he sits normally, his reasoning ability would drop 40%.

Light, born on February 28, 1986, is a third year high school student (12th grade) at Daikoku Private Academy (大国学園, Daikoku Gakuen) who also attends supplemental classes at Gamou Prep Academy in the beginning of the story. Light has a father, Soichiro Yagami, who is the head of the Police Force. Light also has a mother, Sachiko Yagami, and a younger sister, Sayu Yagami.

In Spring 2004, Light becomes a first-year student (freshman) at To-Oh University (東応大学, Tōō Daigaku), becoming one of two freshman representatives; L is the other freshman representative. During a tennis game with L at To-Oh, spectators reveal that Light was the junior high school tennis champion in 1999 and 2000. After his 2000 victory, Light quit tennis as he entered high school.

Yagami Light is a brilliant college student. Nicknamed ""Kira,"" he uses the Death Note to create his ideal world of justice under him; its new God. Though he looks frail, Light is an extremely athletic person, with an aptitude to find an opponent's weak point. He is a genius, which adds to his notion that only he is fit to judge humanity and steer it on a proper moral course.

The original Shinigami who dropped the Death Note in the human world, and also love apples, which Light would pick up. Acting out of pure boredom, Ryuk begins the story of Death Note on a whim. Perhaps neutral by nature, Ryuk often refuses to aid Light and instead enjoys watching him struggle for his goal. The most important facet of Ryuk's character is that he is not Light's friend. He acts for his own interests and entertainment, and often fails to tell Light key details about the Death Note. Ryuk is selfish, however, and will aid Light if it serves his own goals, such as providing amusement or obtaining apples.

In Death Note, Near is the youngest of L's two successors raised in Wammy's House, Watari's orphanage for gifted children, in Winchester, England, United Kingdom. Of the successors, Near is the more level-headed, calmly assessing the situation, while the other, Mello, is more emotional and quick to act. Much like L, Near shows various odd behaviors during his normal life. He is usually seen hunched over rather than sitting. He also constantly plays with various toys, which he uses in his theories, as well as idly twiddling strands of his hair. He shows a great respect for L, basing much of how he solves crime on L's methods, even to the point where he only takes cases that he is interested with rather than trying to pursue justice. Near uses the Wedding Text font ""N"" and ""L"" to represent himself and the fake L, respectively. But later in the aftermath, he used Old English font ""L"" like the original L did. He is voiced by Noriko Hidaka in the Japanese anime, Cathy Weseluck in the English dub, and Bruno Coronel in the Latin Spanish version.


It is speculated by Matsuda in Death Note: Oneshot that Near uses the Death Note to manipulate Mikami into failing Light in the final battle, which would shed light on some major plotholes. It's important to note that Tsugumi Ohba has said that he wanted it to be left up to the readers on if Matsuda is right or not.
Tsugumi Ohba, writer of Death Note, said that Near ""becomes less likeable"" as the story advances, citing Near's plan to take the notebook at a later point in the story. Ohba said that a negative reaction originated from ""the difference in their attitudes"" and that people may have viewed Near as ""a cheat."" Ohba added that Near's ""cheeky behavior,"" intended to ""reinforce his childishness,"" had been construed as ""annoying.""

In the final chapter Near brings finger puppets to the Yellow Box Warehouse. Takeshi Obata, artist of Death Note, said that Near first bought the Kira finger puppet and drew on it with a magic marker. Obata then said that Near must have created the other puppets afterwards. Obata views Near as not liking L much so Obata had Near depict L as ""ugly"", and that Near ""worked hard"" on Mello's puppet as Near ""liked Mello.""

Obata said he enjoyed drawing Near and that Near is also one of his favorite and his least favorite characters, considering him to be the smartest character in the manga ""because he cheats.""

When asked about which character was most similar to himself, Ohba indicated Near and ""maybe Light."" Regarding Near, Ohba said that he does not leave his house often."

Misa is a famous model, singer and actress and has an immense crush on Light Yagami. She usually refers to herself in the third person by calling herself ""Misa-Misa"" and tends to be hyperactive. She poses as the second Kira to attract the attention of the first Kira.


She decides to devote her life to Light because he punished the criminal that killed her parents when she was younger; a burglar killed Misa's parents in front of her eyes. Misa, unable to forgive the killer and wanting to kill the burglar herself, saw multiple delays in the killer's trial before Kira killed him. The Shinigami who follows her is Rem. Misa also performs two eye trades, cutting her lifespan in half twice; the first was with Rem, and the second with Ryuk. According to How to Read 13, Misa falls into despair after learning of Light's death through Matsuda. Misa commits suicide one year later on February 14, 2011.

Mello is the older of L's two successors raised in Wammy's House, Watari's orphanage for gifted children, in Winchester, England, United Kingdom. When it is decided that Mello should work with the other successor, Near, Mello refuses, citing an inability to work with Near, to whom he is considered second. Similar to L's fondness for sweets, Mello is often seen eating bars of chocolate. How to Read 13 states that Mello has ""an excellent mind"" and that he ""sometimes lets his emotions get in his way."" The book cites Mello's ""hatred of Near,"" which created ""a flaw in [Mello's] personality."" The book states that Mello isn't purely evil, citing his apology and genuine care for Matt's well-being. Tsugumi Ohba, the writer of Death Note, stated that Mello ""works hard for everything.""

Mello is voiced by Nozomu Sasaki in the Japanese anime, David Hurtwitz in the English version and Javier Olguín in the Latin Spanish dub.


Mello decides to find Kira his own way by joining the Mafia. After obtaining one of the Death Notes from the Kira investigation team by kidnapping Sayu Yagami, Light Yagami sets up a raid that leaves Mello badly scarred and his real name in Light's hands. After learning that Light is Kira and Near was going to attempt to apprehend him, Mello kidnaps Kiyomi Takada, but is soon killed by Takada's hidden pages of the Death Note. This action causes Teru Mikami to expose his own Death Note to kill Takada, an action that Near picks up on and is eventually able to use to thwart Light's plans. Near reflects this during the final showdown and credits Mello as the single most pivotal person in discovering Light's plans. Hal Lidner further believes that it was Mello's plan that he would be killed to expose Light's plan, but Near rejects this theory. His date of death is January 26th, 2010. Age 20.

In Chapter 98, he fires a smoke bomb at Takada's bodyguards as a distraction to allow Mello to kidnap Takada; in the next chapter he meets face to face with Takada's bodyguards. Inside the back of his shirt, he hid a gun which he tried to take out until he is finally shot multiple times by all thirteen of the bodyguards surrounding him. Mello later sees the news of his death broadcast on TV and apologizes to Matt for his death.

Mikami works as a lawyer, and was bullied for standing up for what is right when he was younger in school. He was an excellent student and did well academically. He became a prosecuting agent to impose the punishment that criminals deserved.

Mikami lives alone and likes to work out consistently, even on New Year's Day. He's maniacally rigorous and punctual, and overall he's a talented and intelligent person who has the tendency to act in a way that is described as ""Kira-like"".

Blood type: B

Tota is known as the most outspoken member in the investigation team. He plays a crucial role in the investigation of the Yotsuba Group after sneaking into the company's building without the knowledge of the team. His designated investigation team alias is Taro Matsui.

By following L's instructions, Matsuda gains the trust of the company's board members, fabricates his death (he uses the alias Taro Matsui) so that Yotsuba members can not kill him), and serves as a temporary decoy to lure the suspect into the Sakura television studio during the second Sakura TV incident. Despite his excitable, naïve personality, Matsuda manages to stay alive through quite a few dangerous times. Matsuda sees Soichiro as his mentor.

While it is clear that most of the investigation team views Kira as a an evil criminal, Matsuda often wonders if Kira is performing good deeds, especially since more and more people seem to be agreeing with what he does. Matsuda is scared by Mikami's intense loyalty to Kira when he hears Mikami's public announcement on Sakura TV. Matsuda proves to be somewhat supportive and sympathetic towards Kira's followers nonetheless.

When Light is revealed as Kira at Yellowbox Warehouse, Matsuda is the most shocked of the team. He has always liked Light and is outraged to learn that he had been fooled; he is particularly upset, asserting that Light's actions had led to the death of Soichiro. Matsuda succeeds in saving Near's life by shooting Light's hand, causing him to drop the pen that he was writing Near's name with. Matsuda shoots him several more times to stop Light from writing Near's name in his own blood. The enraged Matsuda nearly kills Light with a shot to the head, but he is stopped by the rest of the Japanese investigation team.

As shown in the final chapter, Matsuda suspects that, to help with Light's capture, Near has used the Death Note to control Mikami's actions before killing him, but Ide says that he has no proof and it may be a ""wish"" on his part, perhaps related to his thinking of Light as a friend.

Rem is the Shinigami who first gives Misa her Death Note and Shinigami eyes. Similar to Ryuk, Rem possesses two Death Notes; she purposely gives a Death Note to Misa. Rem inherited her second Death Note from Jealous, another Shinigami who died when he saved Misa's life, and thought it only right to pass it on to Misa. Rem inherits Jealous' love for Misa as well and is prompt to defend Misa even at the cost of her life. She shows this when she openly shows her lack of trust for Light stating that if Misa dies before her time, Rem will kill Light. In the manga and anime, Rem tells Misa that she is actually a female Shinigami. In the second live-action film, this is not mentioned, leaving it ambiguous.
